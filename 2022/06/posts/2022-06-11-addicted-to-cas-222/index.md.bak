It's time for a new challenge at [Addicted to
CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)... the code word for challenge
\#222 is DOTS!  There are so many wonderfully fun ideas on the challenge
blog by the design team... I hope you'll go check them out.  And then
you need to create your own dotted masterpieces to share with us!

I wanted to have some fun with the new Stampin' Up! In Color colours for
2022-2024... so I used some old circle punches and cut out a bunch in
three different colours.  I used a Swiss Dots embossing folder for a
little more fun and interest.
