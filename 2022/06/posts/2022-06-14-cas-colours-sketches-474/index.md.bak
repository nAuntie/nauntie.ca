It's time for a new sketch at [CAS Colours and
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/)... We hope you'll
play along with us this week by posting  your creation
[HERE](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/)!

I changed the sketch just a little bit, making the hexagon a little
smaller.  I just purchased these dies from Scrapbook.com and am so happy
I did!  I love the little hint of shiny gold on this card.
