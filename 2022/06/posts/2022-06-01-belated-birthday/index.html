    <p>On this day, 31 years ago, my hubby and I stood in front of family and
friends and said &ldquo;I do&rdquo;.  I know we&rsquo;ve done a lot, seen a lot, made it
through a lot&hellip; but I have no idea where 31 years have gone!  Happy
Anniversary, Babe!</p>
<p>In other news, I saw my surgeon on Monday and he says my wrist is
healing well.  He says my progress is a little ahead of what he&rsquo;d expect
at this point and while I think he said that because I said I was
frustrated with how slow it all is, I will try to remember that I am
improving.  I did a few hours at work yesterday and will be back again
tomorrow morning for a few hours.  </p>
<p>On to the card&hellip;</p>
<p>I have had the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral stamps, dies, stencils
and washi tape in my hands and in my cart so many times, only to put
them back on the shelf.  And then, I bought everything but the washi
tape and immediately wished I had bought the tape&hellip; so I went back and
got it too.  And honestly, if you have this set without the washi tape,
go back and buy the washi&hellip; it&rsquo;s just so darn pretty!</p>
