It's time for a new clean and simple challenge at [AAA
Cards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/)!  We have a sketch for you this
week with the added optional twist of flowers.  Of course I did both
(because I love florals!)  Share your card with us
[HERE](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/) for a chance to be chosen as a
guest designer in an upcoming challenge!

I always struggle with the placement of things like the sketch shows so
I wanted to do something different.  Instead of making those circles my
flowers, I decided to use the idea of circles to colour my floral
image.  It's not exactly like the sketch but I think you can see the
sketch in m creation.
