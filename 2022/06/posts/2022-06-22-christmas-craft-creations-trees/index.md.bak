There's still some time to play along with the [Christmas Craft
Creations](https://christmas-craft-creations.blogspot.com/) June theme
of TREES!  This is a great challenge to help you get a few Christmas
cards made throughout the year.  I had promised myself to make more
Christmas cards before October and while I've done that, it's really
only been for this challenge!  Maybe I should make one day a month where
I make only Christmas cards.

Anyway... I found these Spellbinders Bottlebrush Trees second hand on a
Facebook group and snatched them up.  I knew I wanted to use them for
this challenge.
