Thanks for popping by today!  I'm sharing with you, my card for the
current clean and simple challenge at [AAA
Cards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/).  We want you to use only 1 of
the 9 rectangles on the front of your A2 card when you divide it up
evenly (or 1/9 of any card size you like to use) with the optional twist
of Butterflies.

The 1/9th is the hard part for this card... I decided to use a little
ink blending to create the rectangle to help me envision it... to create
a little dimension, I used glue along the body of the butterfly and foam
adhesive on the wings to make them pop up a bit
