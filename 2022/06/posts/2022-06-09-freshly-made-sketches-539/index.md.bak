I created a quick card to play along with the current sketch at [Freshly
Made
Sketches](https://freshlymadesketches.blogspot.com/2022/06/freshly-made-sketches-529-sketch-by-jen.html)... 
I had the card all put together and ready to photograph and I didn't
like it.  So I used my stitched rectangle die to cut off the front of
the card and layered it on to another card and I like it so much
better.  The extra panel and the stitched lines really helped to make
this card.
