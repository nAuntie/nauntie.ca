I'm playing along with two challenges today... [Color Throwdown
\#696](https://colorthrowdown.blogspot.com/2022/06/color-throwdown-696.html)
and [CAS on Friday
\#233](http://cleanandsimpleonsunday.blogspot.com/2022/06/challenge-233-condoleance.html). 
The colours of the first challenge fit the theme of "condolence" for the
second challenge absolutely perfectly!
