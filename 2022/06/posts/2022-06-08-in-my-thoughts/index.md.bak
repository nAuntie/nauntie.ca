I'm back without another washi tape creation.  The stamp and die with
this Pink Fresh Studio set are one piece so it makes more sense to stamp
it all and then cut it all... the same goes with the washi tape.  When I
cut out the wreath for the card a few days ago, it only made sense to do
it all.  These were the other pieces I had so I threw them all on a
panel to create a card.

I tried a technique that [Jennifer
McGuire](https://www.jennifermcguireink.com/2022/05/adding-texture-without-bulk.html)
showed recently where you put die cuts on a panel and then run it
through your Big Shot (or whatever) with a pierced cover plate die.  It
creates sort of a quilted background, but it's hard to see on what I did
(at least in the photo).
