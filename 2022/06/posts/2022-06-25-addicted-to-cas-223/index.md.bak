Good morning crafty friends... it's time for a new challenge with
[Addicted to CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)!  We are playing
with the code word GRID for this challenge.

I will admit that I struggled with this challenge.  I had no idea how to
interpret this word.  But then I remembered I had some patterned papers
that had a grid-look to them... and I went with the one that was more
delicate looking to create my card for today.
