I am so happy that Samantha chose some of the new Stampin' Up! In Color
colours for our challenge at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/06/challenge-475-colour.html)
this week.  I just love the new colours and especially these three!  I
really hope you'll play along with this colour combination this week!

These colours are just so happy!  They make me think of popsicles, and
beach balls, and shovels and pails... all those wonderfully fun things
in the summer!
