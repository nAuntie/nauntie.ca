I was able to get myself caught up with design team duties and found a
little time to play with some current challenges.  Today I'm sharing the
card I created for the latest sketch at [Freshly Made
Sketches](https://freshlymadesketches.blogspot.com/2022/06/freshly-made-sketches-538-sketch-by.html).

I was able to grab this flower from my bin of extras to add a pop of
colour to my black and white card.
