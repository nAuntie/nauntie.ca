I absolutely love the sketch this week at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/09/challenge-489-sketch.html)! 
My card went together pretty quickly once I decided on what elements I
wanted to use.  I hope you'll play along with us!

My card uses a few pieces from my bin of extras that I kept
overlooking.  I had used just two of the layering stencils and these two
pieces had very little colour on them... so I grabbed my Copics and gave
them a bit more colour before adding them to my card. This could be a
great sketch for Christmas as well (jingle bells, snowflakes, mittens).
