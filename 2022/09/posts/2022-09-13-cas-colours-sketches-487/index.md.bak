There's a new sketch challenge at CAS Colours & Sketches.  This is a
great sketch to showcase a little bit of patterned paper or an embossed
panel... or keep it just a solid colour.  There are so many options!

I saw this sketch and immediately wanted to use this beautiful Stampin'
Up! paper from last year.  It took a while for me to decide what to do
with the other element on the card but I landed on the gnome and I like
how it turned out!
