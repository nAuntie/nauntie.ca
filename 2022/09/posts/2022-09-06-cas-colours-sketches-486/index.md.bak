There's a new host this month at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/09/challenge-486-colors.html)...
Patricia has chosen these fun colours to play with this week!  I hope
you'll play along!

As you will often see me say, I struggled with these colours.  I don't
often put yellow on a card and certainly not with these other colours! 
I wanted to play with ink for this challenge so I had to pull some
similar colours from my stash and I added the Mango Melody in a layer.
