It's time for a no layer card challenge with AAACards... that's right...
just the card itself!  The optional twist is to make it a sympathy card.

Sympathy cards are not a card anyone wants to make... but they are
necessary to have in our stash.  I personally like to make my sympathy
cards subdued... I was curious to see how the silver foil would look on
grey cardstock so that's what I played with for my challenge card. 
While my card looks to be just the card, I cheated just a bit and cut my
grey cardstock to the same size as a folded white card and attached it
to the front.  The only way you might know this isn't a true no layer
card is that the inside is white.  I like to do this as I prefer white
on my card interior.
