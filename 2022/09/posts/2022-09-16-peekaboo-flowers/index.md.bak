Have today off after picking up my coworkers shift on Tuesday.  Feels
strange.  I do go back for a half day tomorrow.  I am off in a few
minutes for a massage and to head to one of my favourite creative stores
to pick up a few things I ordered.  A few other things might also make
it in to my basket!  I hope to come home and create as I'm way behind!!

I think I made a card similar to this but with snowflakes a few years
back...  I thought why not try it with some airy flowers...
