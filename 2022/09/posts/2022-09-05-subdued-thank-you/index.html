    <p>Back in early July we lost a very good friend after a short illness&hellip;
it was devastating to lose a friend that we loved so much.  She was one
of my regular customers in terms of card orders.  Her husband approached
me after her funeral, asking if I would please make him some thank you
cards to send out to people who helped out so much during her brief
illness and after her death&hellip; and I said &ldquo;of course&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He had no guidelines for me, but I knew what I wanted to do&hellip;. I wanted
something subdued and something floral as Steph was a master gardener. 
This was the card I came up with.</p>
