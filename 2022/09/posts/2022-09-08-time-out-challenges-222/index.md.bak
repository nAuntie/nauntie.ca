This is such a beautiful quote by Maya Angelou.... and it's something I
try to do when I'm at work.  I work at the front desk of a chiropractic
clinic and we often see people who are in a lot of pain.  I try had to
be a bright spot in their day, maybe help them feel a little better for
a few minutes while they have to interact with me.  Everyone needs a
rainbow...

I started out my card with a panel of clouds and then added some sparkly
grass and a slightly subdued rainbow...
