I have another special request card to share with you today... a friend
is hosting a Halloween themed baby shower for a good friend of hers and
she asked me to make some thank you cards.Â  I should have thought a bit
more before I came up with this design because it was a LOT of colouring
for someone who struggles to colour!

But I am happy with how they turned out...
