    <p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the team at <a href="https://timeoutchallenges.blogspot.com/2022/10/challenge-224-cancer.html">Time
Out</a>
had originally had our challenge today as a Breast Cancer challenge&hellip;
as a colon cancer survivor (x2), I respectfully asked if we could change
it to a cancer awareness challenge&hellip; everyone knows about and talks
about breast cancer, but no one talks about colon cancer (and many other
cancers).  It&rsquo;s SO important to me that we talk about all forms of
cancer, that we not be embarrassed about talking about our health, our
bodies and the changes we are experiencing.  I shudder to think about
where I&rsquo;d be today had I not mentioned my symptoms to my doctor&hellip; as
embarrassing as it was to talk about bodily functions.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip;.  we would love to see your cancer awareness cards for the
next two weeks&hellip; those cards you&rsquo;d send if your friend or your Mom or
your brother was diagnosed with cancer&hellip; those cards meant to brighten
the day, even if for a minute. </p>

<p>Having been the recipient of many of these cards, I can tell you that
they were bright marks in some very dark moments.  It was so nice to get
the mail and see a card there for me&hellip; it meant I was on the mind of a
friend&hellip; that I wasn&rsquo;t alone&hellip; that there could still be sunshine. 
This sentiment was the perfect one in my mind&hellip;  Do you know someone
who&rsquo;s recently had a cancer diagnosis?  Send them a card.  Don&rsquo;t know
what to say?  A simple &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in my heart&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in my thoughts&rdquo;
or &ldquo;A little sunshine in card form&rdquo; always hit the spot with me&hellip; leave
out the religion unless you know your friend is religious.  Put in
humour if you know that&rsquo;s the type of person they are.  But don&rsquo;t stress
over it&hellip; it truly is the thought that counts!</p>
