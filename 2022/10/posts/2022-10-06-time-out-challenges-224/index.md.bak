October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the team at [Time
Out](https://timeoutchallenges.blogspot.com/2022/10/challenge-224-cancer.html)
had originally had our challenge today as a Breast Cancer challenge...
as a colon cancer survivor (x2), I respectfully asked if we could change
it to a cancer awareness challenge... everyone knows about and talks
about breast cancer, but no one talks about colon cancer (and many other
cancers).  It's SO important to me that we talk about all forms of
cancer, that we not be embarrassed about talking about our health, our
bodies and the changes we are experiencing.  I shudder to think about
where I'd be today had I not mentioned my symptoms to my doctor... as
embarrassing as it was to talk about bodily functions.

Anyway....  we would love to see your cancer awareness cards for the
next two weeks... those cards you'd send if your friend or your Mom or
your brother was diagnosed with cancer... those cards meant to brighten
the day, even if for a minute.

Having been the recipient of many of these cards, I can tell you that
they were bright marks in some very dark moments.  It was so nice to get
the mail and see a card there for me... it meant I was on the mind of a
friend... that I wasn't alone... that there could still be sunshine. 
This sentiment was the perfect one in my mind...  Do you know someone
who's recently had a cancer diagnosis?  Send them a card.  Don't know
what to say?  A simple "you're in my heart" or "you're in my thoughts"
or "A little sunshine in card form" always hit the spot with me... leave
out the religion unless you know your friend is religious.  Put in
humour if you know that's the type of person they are.  But don't stress
over it... it truly is the thought that counts!
