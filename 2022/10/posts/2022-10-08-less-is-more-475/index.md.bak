It's time for a new challenge at [Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)... we are playing with a
one layer card which means we want ONLY ink on paper... no added die
cuts, no layers.  The twist for this challenge is to draw your own
frame.  Please share your creations with us
[HERE](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)!

I shared my first creation for this challenge a few days ago... but then
realized that I couldn't use the die cut butterfly.  I was so
disappointed because I was truly in love with that card!  I created a
very similar frame for this card and did a little stamping to create a
fun birthday card.
