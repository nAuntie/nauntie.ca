It's a 1 of 9 rectangles challenge at
[AAACards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/) with the optional twist of
gnomes... We'd love to see your cards where you use only one of the 9
rectangles found if you divide a rectangular card in 9ths.  Be sure to
keep it clean and simple and share it with us
[HERE](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/)!

You KNEW I'd have to use the optional twist!  I used a non-Christmas
gnome stamp set but added a tiny holiday wish to it to make it a
Christmas card.
