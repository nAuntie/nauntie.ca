I'm not honestly sure about this card... it looks better in person than
it does in this photo, but I'm still not sure about it.  I had these
white tulips cut out from a different project and had originally thought
I'd blend ink on them.  I had them laid out on a white piece of paper
and I kind of liked how they looked so I went with it.
