(I laugh because of the play on words...)

The universe decided to smack me upside the head on the 13th... well,
more of a smack down I suppose.  I was walking from my car to the office
and I managed to slip and fall... and I heard a crack... I ended up in
the Emergency Room for 8 hours and discovered I broke my right wrist.

Did I mention I'm right handed?

They casted me and sent me on my way with an appointment with the
orthopaedic clinic scheduled for next week.  I ended up back in Emerg
for 9 hours Friday because my arm had swollen up so badly.  They ended
up removing my cast, taking more Xrays, doing a CT and then splinting my
arm... and booking me for surgery on the 22nd.  I have 4 separate
fractures in my wrist and the best hope for a good recovery is to add
some hardware to my wrist.

I have cards made however typing one handed is super slow... I will
write up posts for any of the design team stuff I've created but I think
that will be it.  I have no idea how long I'll be away from my creative
space... I'm so sad that I won't be able to create!
