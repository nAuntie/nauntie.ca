Some more love to Pink Fresh Studio and their products... but lucky for
you, I've switched to butterflies from flowers LOL!  This is a great
stamp that stamps up about a dozen butterflies all at once and the die
cuts them all out at once as well.  I stamped up a sheet of them with
black ink and then blended some Tim Holtz inks over the top before
cutting them all out.  I saw a great mini slimline card with a rainbow
of images up the centre and I decided to do one with my butterflies.  I
added some diagonal embossed lines on the front panel and put it all
together with a simple sentiment and a few gems.
