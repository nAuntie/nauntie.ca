It's time for a new challenge with the team at [Less is
More.](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)  As you can see from the
graphic below, the prompt is "occupations".  As always, we hope you'll
play along with our challenge and share your creations with us
[HERE](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)!

I struggled a bit with the challenge as I don't really have any stamps
that scream "occupations" to me... so I had to think outside the box a
little.  We all know I love to create with floral stamps so I decided to
be an artist as my occupation....  I stamped the daisies image and then
used some ink blot stamps to "colour" in the image... an artistic take.

And you know what? I like how it turned out!
