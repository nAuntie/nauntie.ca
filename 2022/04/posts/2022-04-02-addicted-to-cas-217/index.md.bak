Happy Saturday crafty friends!  I'm back with the team at [Addicted to
CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) with another clean and simple
challenge for you all.  We'd love to see your clean and simple cards
featuring animals!  Be sure to share your creations with us
[HERE](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) for your chance to be chosen
as a CAS Perfectionist!!!

I have some animal stamps in my stash that have never seen ink (at least
not by me!) so I decided to pull out one of those sets to play.  This is
\*not\* my usual style, but I think it turned out OK.  Maybe I should
have done a little blue sky shading too...
