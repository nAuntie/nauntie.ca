The team at [Addicted to CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) is
playing with just one layer for challenge \#218.  To me, a one layer
card means there is no other cardstock on the card other than the card
itself.  You can add a few embellishments (pearls if you need to) but
there shouldn't be any layers or dies (unless you do an inlaid
technique).  It's a difficult thing to do... and it's hard to get depth
and movement.

I saw a card on Pinterest a while back that I decided to try as a one
layer card.  The card I saw had this awesome wave of colour, but it was
paper strips that were then covered by layers of white cardstock to
create the wave.  I had to put my thinking cap on to try to figure out
how to make it just one layer.

To create it, I cut a "stencil" with a piece of printer paper using a
wave die I have in my stash.  I cut 1/4" off the length of it and
adhered the two pieces to my card front with green tape from
Scrapbook.com.  I then used sponge daubers (the finger tip ones) and
added my rainbow of Tim Holtz inks to the wave.  I let the coloured
overlap because it would have been way too difficult to not have them
overlapped LOL.  I added some Nuvo Aqua Shimmer to the wave and stamped
my sentiment so it overlapped the wave just a bit.
