design team to see, so I hope you'll head to the blog to see them!  We'd
love to see what you create as well!  Share your creations with us

When I saw the cue card for this challenge, my mind automatically went
to animals....  but honestly, I've made a lot of cards with animals on
them in the last little bit and I was a little tired of them.  So I had
to put on my thinking cap and find something else that could be fluffy. 
The hard part was finding something else that is fluffy that I have in
my stash!  I almost gave up... but then I thought about this cloud
stencil I bought a while back...
