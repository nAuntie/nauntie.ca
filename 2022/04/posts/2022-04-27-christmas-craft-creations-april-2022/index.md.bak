There's still time to play along with the [Christmas Craft
Creations](https://christmas-craft-creations.blogspot.com/) April
challenge!  We'd love to see your Christmas cards using plaid or tartan!

When plaid first started being popular (again), I resisted it.  I
honestly wasn't a big fan.  But over the years it's grown on me! 
There's just something about a good old red and black buffalo check....

I had fun with some Stampin' Up plaid papers and the L'il Gnome from
Simon Says Stamp

I really hope you'll play along with us!!
