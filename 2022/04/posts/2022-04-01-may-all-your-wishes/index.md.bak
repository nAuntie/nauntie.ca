This is another card that I created after stamping up these wonderful
floral images by Pink Fresh Studio.  After I had finished the card, I
decided it needed "something" so I pulled out a black marker to create
the scattered dots around the image... I have stamps that do this
however I chose to do it after everything was already put together.
