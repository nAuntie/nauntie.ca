For our current challenge, we want to see your clean and simple cards
that are decorated "along the edge" with the optional twist of "your
country". Share your creations with us

guest designer for an upcoming challenge!

I had a few ideas for my card to feature my country, but I thought I'd
keep it super simple... can you tell what country I'm from by this
card??
