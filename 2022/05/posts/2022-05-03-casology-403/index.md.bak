Happy Tuesday creative friends... I saw my surgeon yesterday and as
expected, the plaster splint was removed and I now have a removable
brace.  I can wear the brace when I'm up and about or if the arm/wrist
is fatigued.  I have some stretches thatI've started doing that are
really tough but I am told it will all get easier... I am to use my arm
and wrist as tolerated for anything non-weight bearing.  I will start
some physical therapy in a few weeks to help me regain motion and
strength.  It will be about another 4 weeks before I start looking at a
gradual return to work.

Anyway... it's time for a new challenge with
[CASology](https://casology.blogspot.com/2022/05/week-403-botanical.html)...
our cue word for this month is "botanical"

If you've been around a while, you know I love creating with florals, so
this was not a difficult challenge for me!

I love the look of a white on white layer... but I do like to step it up
a bit by adding foam adhesive for some dimension.

  

I hope you will play along with us by sharing your creation
