It's time for a new challenged with [Addicted to
CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)... for the next two weeks, we
want to see you sharing your cards featuring stripes!  I am the host for
this challenge, which means this theme was my idea!  Please share your
clean and simple cards with strips with us
[HERE](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)!

I had a bit of trouble deciding on what I wanted to do for my card for
this challenge... I have a lot of options when it comes to stripes.  In
the end, I am very happy with this card!
