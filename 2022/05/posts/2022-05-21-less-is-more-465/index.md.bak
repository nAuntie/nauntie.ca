It's time for a colour challenge over at the [Less is More
blog](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/).  For this challenge we
are playing with my favourite colour combination... RAINBOW!  There is
some wonderful inspiration to be seen created by the rest of the design
team.. click [HERE](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/) to check

I absolutely love creating with rainbows... they can be bright, muted,
pastel, jewel toned... whatever you feel like!  I received my new
Stampin' Up! In Color cardstock right after I broke my wrist so I pulled
those out (along with a few other colours) to create my rainbow for this
challenge.
