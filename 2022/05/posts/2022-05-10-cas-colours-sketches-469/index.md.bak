Now that I have a little more mobility (and I do mean a little) with my
right hand, I decided to try making a card on yesterday afternoon.  Fine
motor skills are still a bit of a struggle and I had to take a break
part way through, but I managed to get a card done in time for the [CAS
Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/05/challenge-469-sketch.html)
challenge for this week.  

It's a sketch challenge this week... I hope you'll play along with us by
sharing your clean and simple creations following the sketch below. 
Just link that card up
[HERE](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/05/challenge-469-sketch.html)!

I was thankful for my bin of extras as it helped me with the cut
pieces.  All I had to do was cut the patterned paper, stamp the
sentiment and put them all together

I don't honestly know if I'll be able to keep trying to make cards while
I'm healing, but it was really nice to make a cad yesterday.  It's been
almost 4 weeks since I created... the longest I've gone without making a
card in almost 5 years!  Using the hand/arm/wrist is important it
getting motion and strength back but I want to be careful that I don't
overdo it!
