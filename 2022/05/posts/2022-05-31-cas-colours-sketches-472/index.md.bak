Welcome to the last challenge of the moth for [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/05/challenge-472-double-challenge.html). 
As it is the fifth challenge this month, we have both a sketch and a
colour combination for you to use!

I will admit, I am not thrilled with my card.  Maybe my border is too
wide?  It just feels like the Island Indigo overwhelms the rest of the
card.  The rest of the design team has inspiration for you
[HERE](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/05/challenge-472-double-challenge.html)
and I hope that you'll play along with us!
