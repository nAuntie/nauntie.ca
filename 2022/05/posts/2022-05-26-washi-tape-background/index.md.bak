I had so much fun playing with ink on washi tape, that I decided to play
again.  This is a great technique.  You just ink up the sticky side of
the washi tape and put it down on your cardstock and then pull it up
again.  It really gives some fun texture to your card.  This is great
for me as I have some washi tapes that I will probably never use on
cards so I can do something creative with it (instead of just using it
as repositionable adhesive)
