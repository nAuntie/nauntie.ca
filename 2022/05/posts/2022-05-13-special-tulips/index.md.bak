Happy Friday the 13th crafty friends!  If you've been here for a while,
you know that my hubby and I celebrate Friday the 13th as we met (at a
bar in the late 80s) on a Friday the 13th and got engaged on a Friday
the 13th (our oldest son was born on the anniversary of the day Bruce
proposed but it wasn't a Friday).  We've been married 31 years (or it
will be on June 1) so we figure it's a pretty good day.

My card today is using some of the leftovers from the ink blended panels
I created... this time I cut out some tulips and created a mini
slimline!
