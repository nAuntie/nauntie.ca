Happy Friday crafty friends... I thought a bright and happy card might
help my mood.  It's been 6 weeks since the fall that broke my wrist and
I am feeling frustrated at how much pain and limited mobility I still
have.  I see my surgeon on Monday and will talk about trying to get back
to work which will be good... but even then I think going back to work
will be a few hours a few days a week. I'm just having an "oh woe is me"
moment.

Anyway.... I have had this gorgeous floral paper for A LOT of years....
I bought it when I worked at the scrapbook store in 2008!  I like the
little pop of pink on the banner that helps make it pop.
