Happy Saturday!!  I hope that wherever you are right now that the sun is
shining...I'm hoping that Mother Nature got the memo that it's now May
and hopefully the spring snow will be done for the year.  It's currently
pretty lovely, but here in Calgary it can change without much notice!

It's time for a new clean and simple challenge at [Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)... for challenge \#464 we
want to see your clean and simple creations using a tag.

I included a tag shape on a card but you could make a tag if you'd
prefer.  I cut the shape out of patterned paper and layered it on to a
tag cut out of cardstock to add a little dimension.
