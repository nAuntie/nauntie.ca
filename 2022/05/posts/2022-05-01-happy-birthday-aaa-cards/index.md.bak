birthday!!  We hope you'll celebrate along with us by creating a clean
and simple birthday card and sharing with us
[HERE](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/).  No birthday would be complete
without presents so there are some prizes to be won as well!  Head to
the [AAACards blog](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/) for all of the

Someone posted about an easy interactive card idea that [Jennifer
McGuire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESrcpGjEc&t=574s) did a video
on... so I watched the video and decided to give it a try.  I tried to
keep mine a little more to my clean and simple style...

And here's with the pull tab pulled.... I should have dressed it up a
bit more, maybe...  The card also opens for you to write in.

I started to type out all the card info here for you... I feel bad that
I haven't been sharing it.  But honestly, this one handed typing takes
forever and I got too frustrated to bother (also, please excuse my
typos... my laptop only does autocorrect in some programs... this is nit
one of them lol)
