It's the 5th Tuesday of the month so we have a double challenge for you
at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-485-double.html)! 
We've taken some retired Stampin' Up! colours and an old sketch and want
to see you combine the two to create something beautiful!

I had to move the sentiment on my card as it just didn't feel right
floating up there in the left corner like in the sketch.  I even made a
square card, which I don't do very often!
