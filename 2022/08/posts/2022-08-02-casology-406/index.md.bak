SAND. I hope you'll check out what the rest of the design team has
created and maybe even share a creation of your own!!  You'll find the

Despite loving the beach, I don't have a lot of a things that are beach
themed... so I had to think about how to create something with this
cue.   I decided to "sand" the raised parts off of an embossed piece...
but how to make it clean and simple?  As you can see from the photo, I
placed a circle in my embossing folder to create a small embossed
element instead of an entire background. Foil cardstock is great for
this technique because the white core of the paper shows when you sand
it.
