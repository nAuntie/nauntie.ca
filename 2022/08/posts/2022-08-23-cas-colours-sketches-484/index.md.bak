It's time for another sketch challenge at [CAS Colours and
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-484-sketch.html). 
You can rotate the sketch if you like, but we need to be able to see the
essence of the sketch in your creation.  And those rectangles?  You can
use any shape you want!

My card was going to be one layer... until I messed up the place of my
splats so I trimmed down a front panel and adhered it to a new card.  I
wasn't sure about white on white layers for a while but now I see them
as versatile to not only fix mistakes or hide ink that bleeds through
(Copics), but they add a little bit of visual interest without being
overwhelming on an otherwise clean and simple card.
