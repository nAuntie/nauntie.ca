Happy Tuesday creative friends!  It's time for a new challenge with the
team at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-481-colours.html)...
and for the month of August, I am the host!  We are staring off this
month with a colour challenge.  I can't wait to see what everyone
creates using these great colours!  Be sure to check out the [CAS
Colours & Sketches
blog](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-481-colours.html)
to see what the rest of the design team created!

I went for a graphic use of these colours... and these Spellbinders
Colorblock dies are awesome for this!  I simply cut out the hexagon once
on each colour of cardstock and layered them together to get three
different hexagons.   As always I love the look of a thin dark mat to
create a frame to draw your eye towards the design.
