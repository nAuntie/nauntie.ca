Why do the months of June, July and August seem to fly by while
December, January and February go by at a snails pace?  I am in awe that
summer in already half over!  I know there's still lots of warm sunny
weather to come, but it feels like it's going by so fast!

I saw a card using this layout on Pinterest and wanted to play with it. 
For some it would still be considered clean and simple, but for others
it is not.  Clean and simple really is subjective.  While I love to play
with truly clean and simple styles, I do enjoy making cards that are a
little outside my comfort zone as well.  This one didn't stretch the
comfort zone too far...
