It's time for a new sketch challenge at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-482-sketch.html)...
I'm hosting this month so this is a sketch I came up with.  As always,
you can rotate or flip the sketch but you need to make sure that the
essence of the sketch remains true... and remember to keep your card
clean and simple!

Be sure to head over to the [CAS Colours & Sketches
Blog](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-482-sketch.html)
to see how the rest of the design team interpreted the sketch and to
share your creation with us!

I love the look of images that fall off of a layer... for my card, I cut
a layer smaller than my card base and added a die cut that falls over
the edge.

And this is the first card I'm sharing using my new toy!  I bought
myself a Glimmer Hot Foil Machine for my birthday last month!
