I had to play along with the latest challenge at [Color
Throwdown](https://colorthrowdown.blogspot.com/2022/08/color-throwdown-706.html)
because I really love the look of blue and green together.

I usually choose the brighter forms of these colours to go together but
I strayed from that with this card to use up a scrap of very old
patterned paper I had in my stash.
