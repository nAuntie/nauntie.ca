There's a new challenge at [Addicted to
CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) today... time to show us your
clean and simple creations featuring the colour pink!

I don't know why but I struggled with this prompt....  but then I gabbed
out some stencils and had a little play with them.  I stencilled the
pink swirls first and then put a second stencil on top of the first
stencil and used Glimmer Paste so that the sparkly circles only showed
up on the pink swirls.
