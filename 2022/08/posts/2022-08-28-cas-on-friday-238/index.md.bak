I found a little time earlier this week to play along with the current
TAG challenge at [CAS on
Friday](http://cleanandsimpleonsunday.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-238-tags.html). 
I have had this idea in my head for a bit and finally put it together
for this card.  I wanted to do it with just the tag on the card front to
keep it more CAS but it just didn't look right... I had this piece of
embossed cardstock on my desk, the leftovers from a previous creation,
so I tried it and loved it!
