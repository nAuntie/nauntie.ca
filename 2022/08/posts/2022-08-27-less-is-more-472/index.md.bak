The new challenge at [Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/) is to use vellum. There
are so many different ways to use vellum in your creations and I can't
wait to see what you all come up with!

I had a few ideas in my head about how I wanted to use vellum and I
decided I wanted to try foiling on it to see if it would work.  I'm here
to report that it works pretty well, although there are some splotchy
spots so I wouldn't recommend doing anything that isn't line art or
sentiments.

As I'm sure you know, adhering vellum can be difficult since any
adhesive (even ones meant for vellum) will show through so I placed a
gem on the 1 o'clock spot to hold the vellum there and added the purple
and pink vine of leaves on the left to adhere it there.
