It's been a long week away from my creative space as I've been isolating
in the main bedroom of our home because I got Covid.  Honestly I didn't
have a lot of energy some days so I didn't miss the creative time all
that much, but as I started to feel better I wished I could sit at my
desk and play.  I am now feeling better and out of isolation but wearing
a mask when others are around.

Honestly, if it's not one thing it's another for me lately!  I'm doing
my best to remember that it could all be so much worse but some days I
just shake my head and think "why me!".  Since April I've had a broken
wrist, seized muscles and now Covid.  Covid happened with good timing
since my one co-worker left this past weekend for a 6 week vacation and
there's no time for me to be sick now!

Anyway... I stamped up this image and I was going to colour it in but
while it was sitting there waiting for me to colour, I decided to see
what it would look like as just a black and white card... and honestly,
I think I love it!
