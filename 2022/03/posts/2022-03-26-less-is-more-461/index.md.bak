Happy Saturday crafty friends!  I usually work on Saturdays (my work
week is Wednesday thru Saturday) but I get one Saturday off each
month...  this is that Saturday.  I love my job, I really truly do...
but I do look forward to my Saturdays off!

It's time for a new challenge with the team at [Less Is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)... our clean and simple
challenge for the next two weeks is to use the colours pink and gold. 
Truly a lovely and classic combination, perfect for a clean and simple
card.

I actually created a different card for the challenge that I'll share in
a few days... but I decided it was too busy for a clean and simple
challenge, so I modified my design to create this card instead.
