I am so often in awe at how fast time flies by.  I can't believe that
we're at the end of March already.  Here in Calgary that means that the
weather is unpredictable.  It can be sunny and warm one day and snowing
the next.  Today is cloudy and cool but there is no snow on the
ground... so I'll be happy about that.

I've been trying to use products that I don't tent to grab for
regularly...  I've been doing some ink blending playing with some
alcohol inks too.  I struggle with getting messy (isn't that sad?).

I did an ombre effect with some Distress Inks before die cutting the
letters.... and of course added my favourite black and white strips
paper!
