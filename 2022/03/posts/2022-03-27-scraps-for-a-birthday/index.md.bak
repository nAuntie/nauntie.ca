I reached in to the bin of extras for the card today...  a little strip
of patterned paper, an even smaller strip of cardstock and some flowers
I'd cut out for something else.  I love it when these cards can come
together like this.

That strip of bright green cardstock was literally in my recycling
bin..... it was a long skinny strip that I trimmed off for another card
and I just made it the right length for the front of the card.
