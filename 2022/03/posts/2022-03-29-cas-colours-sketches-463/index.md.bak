It's a Tuesday, so it's time for a new challenge with [CAS Colours and
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/03/challenge-463-double.html). 
As it is the fifth Tuesday of a month, our challenge is a double...
Jeanne has chosen a past sketch and some retired colours to play with
this week!  Please make sure to have these three colours as the
prominent colours of your clean and simple creation (but you can add
neutrals as well).  You are welcome to flip or rotate the sketch as long
as the essence of the sketch remains.

I didn't have any Watermelon Wonder so I had to improvise with my
stash... and since I don't think it quite matches, I made it the
smallest amount of colour I could LOL
