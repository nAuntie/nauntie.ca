A few weeks ago my friend Bonnie and I went to one of our favourite
local stamp stores after I was done work.  I will admit I bought a few
things I didn't need... but I am so happy I did!  This fabulous floral
set from Pink Fresh is perfect for my colouring preferences... You'll
see a few cards using this set in the next several days as I stamped
them up at once and spent some time colouring.
