I just love these floral swag stamps and dies...  I stamped this one,
coloured it and cut it out so that it could go over the edges of the
layers I placed on the front of this card.  Have I told you lately how
much I LOVE my perfect layers tool to create those beautiful 1/16"
borders???

Let me tell you about another tool I am in LOVE with lately.  My friend
at [Calgary Laser
Creations](https://www.facebook.com/CalgaryLaserCreations/) is a
papercrafter at heart and she has created some acrylic tools to help you
get your layers on even and straight.  She calls them Fricken Square
Corners.  You'll need something with a hard right angle raised edge
(like your stamping platform or scoring tool) to use these.  You simply
choose the right angle corner based on the size of your top layer, place
your cardstock in the corner of the scoring tool (that's what I use),
then the Fricken Square Corner tool (isn't that a great name??!!) in the
corner and then get your layer right in to the corner and adhere it
down.

Laura created a video you can see
