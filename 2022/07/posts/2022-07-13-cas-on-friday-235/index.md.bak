Good morning friends...  a quick post from me today to share my
creations for the current [CAS on
Friday](http://cleanandsimpleonsunday.blogspot.com/2022/07/challenge-235-silhouette.html)
challenge.  The current challenge is "silhouette" and instead of
stamping, I did a black die cut instead.    I used my Copics to create a
little rainbow and then put the die cut floral spring on top of it. 
Because I used Copics, I used a smaller panel and put it on top of a
white card so that the ink bleeding wouldn't show through to the inside
of the card.
