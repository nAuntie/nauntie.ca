I had a bunch of extra white flowers sitting in my bin of extras (that
makes it sound huge... it's just a Gladware sandwich sized container)
and I decided to colour them up with some soft ink blending to create a
little wreath of flowers to go with this new sunburst embossing folder
that I purchased.
