The current challenge at [CAS on
Friday](http://cleanandsimpleonsunday.blogspot.com/2022/06/challenge-234-thank-you.html)
is to make a thank you card.  I love these open daisies by A Jillian
Vance Design.  I paired them with some of the new Stampin' Up! In Color
colours to create my card for the challenge.
