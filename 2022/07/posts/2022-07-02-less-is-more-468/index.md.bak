It's time for a new challenge with [Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)....  our cue word for
challenge \#468 is "emboss".  You can use any interpretation of the word
in your clean and simple card.

I decided to go with an embossing folder for my card... and I grabbed
the etched butterflies from my pile of extras from the card I shared a
few days ago as I think they look embossed as well.
