It's time for you to be inspired by words with the latest [Time Out
Challenge](https://timeoutchallenges.blogspot.com)... you can see the
quote in the graphic below.  Our sponsor for this challenge is Newton's
Nook...  if you share your card with us you'll have a chance at winning
a prize from them!

I read this quote over and over and over again and the word that stood
out to me each time was "dream"... so I made a "dreamy" card for you.

This card was so super simple... some ombre glitter paper from Stampin'
Up! and I used my Silhouette to create the word and cut it out 3 times
and layered it up.  I was going to add more to it but fell in love with
it just like this.
