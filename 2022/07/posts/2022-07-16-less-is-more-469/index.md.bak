There's a colour challenge at [Simply Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)... and that challenge is
traditional Christmas.  I hope you'll dig out some of your Christmas
stash and play along with us!

To me, the traditional colours of Christmas are red, green and gold....
and I think "sparkle" should be a Christmas colour as well LOL!  I just
love sparkly things, especially for Christmas cards!
