I loved the ease of the sketch by Kim at [Freshly Made
Sketches](https://freshlymadesketches.blogspot.com/2022/06/freshly-made-sketches-542-sketch-by-kim.html)
this week.

I combined the idea of using patterned paper with Kim's idea of
horizontal stripes to create my card.  I also used a stamp and die that
I bought YEARS ago that I've never used!
