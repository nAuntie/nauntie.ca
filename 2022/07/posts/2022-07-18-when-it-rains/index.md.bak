My blog title has nothing to do with my card today... but it has to do
with what's going on in my world.  As you know, I broke my right wrist
in April.  While I am getting mobility and strength back in that wrist,
it would appear that the muscles around my right shoulder don't like
that I've been using the arm in awkward ways and they have now seized up
making it near impossible to sit upright at my desk, let alone create. 
This has been going on for two weeks now despite several massages and
chiropractic adjustments.  I haven't found any medications that
alleviate the pain I'm in.  Just sitting here to write blog posts is
difficult.

So until this gets sorted out a bit better, my blog posts may be
sporadic.  I have a bit of design team stuff done for this coming week
that I will post but I'm not sure how often I'll be posting other than
that.  I hope it gets sorted soon as I am really missing my creative
time...

I will share a quick card for you today....
