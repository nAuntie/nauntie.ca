I will admit that I love stencils... and I have a few dozen... but I
hardly use them because I feel intimidated by them.  I think it's
because I prefer the clean and simple style for my creations and
stencils tend to be pretty busy.  I've been trying to pull them out to
play with a little more often...  For this card I used the ink through
the stencil and then the same colours of inks over top without the
stencil to soften the look a little bit.  This is one of the computer
generated sentiments I printed with my laser printer and foiled.
