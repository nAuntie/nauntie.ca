It's time for a new colour challenge at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/07/challenge-479-colors.html)! 
Two of these colours are not my favourites... one of them I honestly
only have two sheets of thanks to my friend
[Bonnie](https://www.bonniecreates.com/) giving them to me!  But I will
admit... this is a great colour combination and I am pretty happy with
how my card turned out!

As I don't have many Stampin' Up! ink pads any more and I struggle with
trying to find suitable matches with the inks I do have, most of my
colour challenges will have cardstock as the colours instead.  I think
this simple design turned out pretty good!
