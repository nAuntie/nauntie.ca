I love the inspiration photo from the current [Color
Throwdown](https://colorthrowdown.blogspot.com/2022/06/color-throwdown-699.html)
challenge so I had to play along.  But then I was stumped as to what I
wanted to do...  I do much better with sketch challenges than colour
challenges I think!

I pulled out a stencil I haven't used yet and this is the result.  I was
going to orient my card the other way however the glitter paste made a
mess in one area under the stencil so I flipped the panel and covered it
with my sentiment!
