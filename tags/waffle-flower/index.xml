      <description>It is with some sadness that I am here with the final challenge at CASology... after many years of wonderful clean and simple challenges, Melissa has decided it is time to retire the CASology Challenge. I think it would be an awesome send off to have a lot of cards submitted for this final challenge&amp;hellip; an awesome tribute to a great challenge and to a great team of inspiring CAS creators.</description>

      <description>I am loving my new Glimmer Foil Machine and I just know I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it a lot during my Christmas card making season (which I think will begin very shortly!). The plate I used for this card is supposed to go across the card to create &amp;ldquo;lights&amp;rdquo; but I liked how it gave a neat background to play with going vertically instead.

      <description>This card is a mix of some extras fro my bin and some other things I cut especially for this card. I knew I wanted a wreath like card so I cut the knotted circle and then dug through my bin of extras for some flowers and leaves that might work. I then foiled my sentiment and cut it out to finish off the card.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re back with another Addicted to CAS challenge&amp;hellip;
Just a quick post for me before I head off to work. I usually do my blogging on Wednesday mornings before work and I lost Wednesday morning to Urgent Care (see yesterdays post) so I am feeling more than a little behind!

      <description>Have today off after picking up my coworkers shift on Tuesday. Feels strange. I do go back for a half day tomorrow. I am off in a few minutes for a massage and to head to one of my favourite creative stores to pick up a few things I ordered. A few other things might also make it in to my basket! I hope to come home and create as I&amp;rsquo;m way behind!</description>

      <description>One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t love about the Pink Fresh Studio washi tapes is that when you use them, you kind of need to use the entire panel which means you always end up with pieces you don&amp;rsquo;t need right away. These pieces go in to my bin of extras and I pull them out when I have a need for them. Sometimes it means I have several cards in a row that look similar.</description>

      <description>The most difficult part of this card was getting the gold cord to look good&amp;hellip;. LOL! I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I like how it turned out but after about 12 minutes of fiddling with it, I decided to leave it alone.

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of square cards&amp;hellip;. there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with them, they look great, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t stray from my usual size very often. But for some reason, when I was designing this card, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on a regular A2 card so I changed things up and LOVE how it looks on the square! I added two extra pieces from the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral Washi tape to the wreath for a little something &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at CASology... our cue for you for July is WINDY.
I have a funny wind story&amp;hellip; last fall we put up some security cameras over our garage. Since the trees have leafed this year, we often get alerts from the cameras of &amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; the other day we had hundreds of alerts in the morning when we work up&amp;hellip; each one of them was the leaves on the trees thanks to the wind!</description>

      <description>I saw a few cards on some Facebook groups I&amp;rsquo;m on as well as on Instagram, using the current challenge from Color Hues&amp;hellip; and while I don&amp;rsquo;t often reach for yellow, I really felt like I wanted to play along with this challenge. I love black and white with a pop of colour&amp;hellip; I usually do red, but yellow sure does look happy!

      <description>Now that I have a little more mobility (and I do mean a little) with my right hand, I decided to try making a card on yesterday afternoon. Fine motor skills are still a bit of a struggle and I had to take a break part way through, but I managed to get a card done in time for the CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches challenge for this week. It&amp;rsquo;s a sketch challenge this week&amp;hellip; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us by sharing your clean and simple creations following the sketch below.</description>

      <description>Some more fun with those Pink Fresh Studio small butterflies and Tim Holtz inks. While I love how easy it was to get a lot of butterflies stamped and cut out at once, I wonder if I should have bought a stamp set with individual stamps and dies instead so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to overload on them all at once like I did with the flowers and now the butterflies.</description>
