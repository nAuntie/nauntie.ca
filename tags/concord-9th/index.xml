      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the month which means there is a new CASology challenge. Our cue for this month is HAPPY!
The cue is easy for me as the majority of the cards I make are for birthdays&amp;hellip; I pulled out some rainbow colours and an alphabet die set and created this for you!
Card Info
*Cardstock: Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Basic Black, Poppy Parade, Daffodil Delight, Granny Apple Green, Pacific Point, Highland Heather</description>

      <description>The most difficult part of this card was getting the gold cord to look good&amp;hellip;. LOL! I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I like how it turned out but after about 12 minutes of fiddling with it, I decided to leave it alone.
