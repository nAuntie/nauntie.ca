      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Less is More&amp;hellip; we are playing with a one layer card which means we want ONLY ink on paper&amp;hellip; no added die cuts, no layers. The twist for this challenge is to draw your own frame. Please share your creations with us HERE!
I shared my first creation for this challenge a few days ago&amp;hellip; but then realized that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the die cut butterfly.</description>

      <description>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the team at Time Out had originally had our challenge today as a Breast Cancer challenge&amp;hellip; as a colon cancer survivor (x2), I respectfully asked if we could change it to a cancer awareness challenge&amp;hellip; everyone knows about and talks about breast cancer, but no one talks about colon cancer (and many other cancers). It&amp;rsquo;s SO important to me that we talk about all forms of cancer, that we not be embarrassed about talking about our health, our bodies and the changes we are experiencing.</description>

      <description>Hello again, crafty friends! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours and Sketches. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how you all create with the colours below!
I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before&amp;hellip; I struggled with these three colours. This was a new level of struggle for me. If I wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the design team, I probably would have passed it up. I just could not do anything that I liked with these colours.</description>

      <description>It is with some sadness that I am here with the final challenge at CASology... after many years of wonderful clean and simple challenges, Melissa has decided it is time to retire the CASology Challenge. I think it would be an awesome send off to have a lot of cards submitted for this final challenge&amp;hellip; an awesome tribute to a great challenge and to a great team of inspiring CAS creators.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a 1 of 9 rectangles challenge at AAACards with the optional twist of gnomes&amp;hellip; We&amp;rsquo;d love to see your cards where you use only one of the 9 rectangles found if you divide a rectangular card in 9ths. Be sure to keep it clean and simple and share it with us HERE!
You KNEW I&amp;rsquo;d have to use the optional twist! I used a non-Christmas gnome stamp set but added a tiny holiday wish to it to make it a Christmas card.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge at Addicted to CAS that starts today. The code word is Autumn. Play along with us by sharing you clean and simple cards HERE!
I had fun doing a little ink blending on a piece of cardstock and then stamping and cutting out these fun leaves. I don&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of brown in my cards but an autumn theme and these colours called for some brown.</description>

      <description>I absolutely love the sketch this week at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches! My card went together pretty quickly once I decided on what elements I wanted to use. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us!
My card uses a few pieces from my bin of extras that I kept overlooking. I had used just two of the layering stencils and these two pieces had very little colour on them&amp;hellip; so I grabbed my Copics and gave them a bit more colour before adding them to my card.</description>

      <description>October 1st is World Cardmaking Day and here at Less is More, we are celebrating a little early with a friendship themed challenge! We think making a card for a friend is a great way to celebrate World Cardmaking Day! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along!
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of very good friends who are always there for me&amp;hellip; to listen, to provide support, to make me laugh, to distract me, to do social things with&amp;hellip; so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a card that I could give to one of them.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new photo inspiration challenge at Time Out Challenges. Our sponsor for this challenge is Newton&amp;rsquo;s Nook and as always, we thank them for their generousity!
This is such a lovely image to get inspiration from. I used the tree along the side of the photo along with some silver and grey for my inspiration

      <description>We have a colour challenge for you at AAACards this week&amp;hellip; with the optional twist of spots and dots. Use the graphic below to get your colour inspiration for your clean and simple cards.
The colours were a bit tough for me because while they look fine on this graphic, I had trouble getting them together on a card. I tried three different things before this one stuck&amp;hellip;

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re back with another Addicted to CAS challenge&amp;hellip;
Just a quick post for me before I head off to work. I usually do my blogging on Wednesday mornings before work and I lost Wednesday morning to Urgent Care (see yesterdays post) so I am feeling more than a little behind!

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new sketch challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. This is a great sketch to showcase a little bit of patterned paper or an embossed panel&amp;hellip; or keep it just a solid colour. There are so many options!
I saw this sketch and immediately wanted to use this beautiful Stampin&#39; Up! paper from last year. It took a while for me to decide what to do with the other element on the card but I landed on the gnome and I like how it turned out!</description>

I used a portion of a great Poppy Stamps frame die to create the focal point on my card. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about the uneven white mat around my focal point&amp;hellip; hmmmm Card Info

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a word prompt challenge at Time Out Challenges. We have a $25 gift card to Lawn Fawn up for grabs for one lucky player!!
This is such a beautiful quote by Maya Angelou&amp;hellip;. and it&amp;rsquo;s something I try to do when I&amp;rsquo;m at work. I work at the front desk of a chiropractic clinic and we often see people who are in a lot of pain. I try had to be a bright spot in their day, maybe help them feel a little better for a few minutes while they have to interact with me.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new host this month at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; Patricia has chosen these fun colours to play with this week! I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along!
As you will often see me say, I struggled with these colours. I don&amp;rsquo;t often put yellow on a card and certainly not with these other colours! I wanted to play with ink for this challenge so I had to pull some similar colours from my stash and I added the Mango Melody in a layer.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the month which means there is a new CASology challenge. Our cue for this month is HAPPY!
The cue is easy for me as the majority of the cards I make are for birthdays&amp;hellip; I pulled out some rainbow colours and an alphabet die set and created this for you!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a no layer card challenge with AAACards&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s right&amp;hellip; just the card itself! The optional twist is to make it a sympathy card.
Sympathy cards are not a card anyone wants to make&amp;hellip; but they are necessary to have in our stash. I personally like to make my sympathy cards subdued&amp;hellip; I was curious to see how the silver foil would look on grey cardstock so that&amp;rsquo;s what I played with for my challenge card.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at Addicted to CAS. This challenge was difficult for me&amp;hellip;. because I don&amp;rsquo;t like birds! I have a few in my stash but they don&amp;rsquo;t really get used. But something different happened when the current Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! catalogue came out and I NEEDED these sweet bird stamps and the punch that goes with it!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the 5th Tuesday of the month so we have a double challenge for you at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches! We&amp;rsquo;ve taken some retired Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! colours and an old sketch and want to see you combine the two to create something beautiful!
I had to move the sentiment on my card as it just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right floating up there in the left corner like in the sketch. I even made a square card, which I don&amp;rsquo;t do very often!</description>

      <description>The new challenge at Less is More is to use vellum. There are so many different ways to use vellum in your creations and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what you all come up with! I had a few ideas in my head about how I wanted to use vellum and I decided I wanted to try foiling on it to see if it would work. I&amp;rsquo;m here to report that it works pretty well, although there are some splotchy spots so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend doing anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t line art or sentiments.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Time Out Challenges with a wonderful prize from Birch Press Designs to be won!! I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along, sharing your FESTIVE cards!!
I know that Festive can refer to a lot of different things, but to me, festive is Christmas&amp;hellip; so I made a Christmas Card using a product I bought at the end of the season last year and hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet played with.</description>

My winter activity is playing in the snow&amp;hellip;. you can see I had fun building an igloo and decorating it! In reality, I had more fun playing with my Glimmer Hot Foil Machine to create my snowy background LOL!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another sketch challenge at CAS Colours and Sketches. You can rotate the sketch if you like, but we need to be able to see the essence of the sketch in your creation. And those rectangles? You can use any shape you want!
My card was going to be one layer&amp;hellip; until I messed up the place of my splats so I trimmed down a front panel and adhered it to a new card.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a moodboard challenge at AAACards&amp;hellip; you can take inspiration from any portion of the moodboard and create a clean and simple card to share with us!
I simply chose the health care part of the moodboard and made a get well card with a sweet puppy.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge at Addicted to CAS today&amp;hellip; time to show us your clean and simple creations featuring the colour pink!
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I struggled with this prompt&amp;hellip;. but then I gabbed out some stencils and had a little play with them. I stencilled the pink swirls first and then put a second stencil on top of the first stencil and used Glimmer Paste so that the sparkly circles only showed up on the pink swirls.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches that starts today&amp;hellip;. these colours are PERFECT to use on a black background if you like that sort of popping neon appearance. We always love to see what others do with our sketches and colour combinations so I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along and share your card with us!
I absolutely LOVE how some colours just POP off of a black background.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the first clean and simple challenge of August with AAACards. Our challenge for the next two weeks is &amp;ldquo;small and few&amp;rdquo; which means you should use a few small images on your card&amp;hellip; the optional twist is (lady)bugs. The design team has some wonderful inspiration on the blog. We hope to see you playing along with us!
I love ladybugs and they are so easy to colour for someone like me who doesn&amp;rsquo;t find colouring zen-inducing.</description>

As I recently had another challenge that was a tropical theme (where I did florals) I decided to turn my focus to a tropical drink instead.</description>

Despite loving the beach, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of a things that are beach themed&amp;hellip; so I had to think about how to create something with this cue.</description>

This was tough for me because I had two design team obligations that were a similar theme back to back! And the themes aren&amp;rsquo;t something I find easy to do in the first place!</description>

      <description>The code word at Addicted to CAS is Nautical&amp;hellip; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along. The design team has created some fun ideas that you can see HERE.
I had a bit in my stash that would have been ok for this challenge but nothing that was speaking to me&amp;hellip; so I used some dies to create my nautical themed card instead.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches! Two of these colours are not my favourites&amp;hellip; one of them I honestly only have two sheets of thanks to my friend Bonnie giving them to me! But I will admit&amp;hellip; this is a great colour combination and I am pretty happy with how my card turned out!
As I don&amp;rsquo;t have many Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! ink pads any more and I struggle with trying to find suitable matches with the inks I do have, most of my colour challenges will have cardstock as the colours instead.</description>

To me, the traditional colours of Christmas are red, green and gold&amp;hellip;. and I think &amp;ldquo;sparkle&amp;rdquo; should be a Christmas colour as well LOL! I just love sparkly things, especially for Christmas cards!

I read this quote over and over and over again and the word that stood out to me each time was &amp;ldquo;dream&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; so I made a &amp;ldquo;dreamy&amp;rdquo; card for you.</description>

I tried a few different things with this sketch and tossed them all in the bin&amp;hellip; until I decided to turn the sketch and then I came up with something I liked on my first try.</description>

You know I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy colouring so I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go out for my animal&amp;hellip; so I chose this cute little birdie and coloured him up very simply. I love the mostly white card with just a hint of colour on the birdie.</description>

      <description>Patricia is our host for the month of July at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; she chose this wonderfully right colour palette for our first challenge this month.
Being a part of this design team, I have discovered that I am much better at sketch challenges than I am with colour challenges. When I was only playing along, if the colours didn&amp;rsquo;t speak to me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play. If the colours were at all challenging to me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at CASology... our cue for you for July is WINDY.
I have a funny wind story&amp;hellip; last fall we put up some security cameras over our garage. Since the trees have leafed this year, we often get alerts from the cameras of &amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; the other day we had hundreds of alerts in the morning when we work up&amp;hellip; each one of them was the leaves on the trees thanks to the wind!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with Less is More&amp;hellip;. our cue word for challenge #468 is &amp;ldquo;emboss&amp;rdquo;. You can use any interpretation of the word in your clean and simple card.
I decided to go with an embossing folder for my card&amp;hellip; and I grabbed the etched butterflies from my pile of extras from the card I shared a few days ago as I think they look embossed as well.</description>

I got these wonderful new dies from Paper Rose and couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to play with them. I love how they look cut out of the gold foil cardstock!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the last sketch challenge for the month of June with CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; our sketch this time is a slimline card and I went for a mini-slimline as I prefer that size.
I took, a large floral stamp but only used a part of it so it would fit on my card. I even pulled out my Copics to do a little colouring (which isn&amp;rsquo;t easy as my wrist heals)</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at AAA Cards! We have a sketch for you this week with the added optional twist of flowers. Of course I did both (because I love florals!) Share your card with us HERE for a chance to be chosen as a guest designer in an upcoming challenge!
I always struggle with the placement of things like the sketch shows so I wanted to do something different.</description>

      <description>Good morning crafty friends&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with Addicted to CAS! We are playing with the code word GRID for this challenge. I will admit that I struggled with this challenge. I had no idea how to interpret this word. But then I remembered I had some patterned papers that had a grid-look to them&amp;hellip; and I went with the one that was more delicate looking to create my card for today.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still some time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations June theme of TREES! This is a great challenge to help you get a few Christmas cards made throughout the year. I had promised myself to make more Christmas cards before October and while I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, it&amp;rsquo;s really only been for this challenge! Maybe I should make one day a month where I make only Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>I am so happy that Samantha chose some of the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours for our challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches this week. I just love the new colours and especially these three! I really hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with this colour combination this week!
These colours are just so happy! They make me think of popsicles, and beach balls, and shovels and pails&amp;hellip; all those wonderfully fun things in the summer!</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new one layer card challenge over at Simply Less is More&amp;hellip; a one layer card means there are no other pieces of cardstock other than your card base. If you want to use dies, they have to be inlaid. For me, the best way to achieve a one layer card is some simple stamping.
*you may add words as well*
I had a thought in my head but had trouble getting all of the pieces together.</description>

I had some fun with the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Colours and an old stamp and die set. Some of the leaves are stamped, some are cut out&amp;hellip; I was able to create a little more dimension this way.</description>

I changed the sketch just a little bit, making the hexagon a little smaller. I just purchased these dies from Scrapbook.com and am so happy I did! I love the little hint of shiny gold on this card.

      <description>Thanks for popping by today! I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with you, my card for the current clean and simple challenge at AAA Cards. We want you to use only 1 of the 9 rectangles on the front of your A2 card when you divide it up evenly (or 1/9 of any card size you like to use) with the optional twist of Butterflies.
The 1/9th is the hard part for this card&amp;hellip; I decided to use a little ink blending to create the rectangle to help me envision it&amp;hellip; to create a little dimension, I used glue along the body of the butterfly and foam adhesive on the wings to make them pop up a bit</description>

In Color colours for 2022-2024&amp;hellip; so I used some old circle punches and cut out a bunch in three different colours.</description>

You may also use neutral colours; however, the challenge colours should be the most noticeable ones featured on your card. We use Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up colour names for reference, but you are welcome to use any other companies&amp;rsquo; products as long as you match the challenge colours as closely as possible.</description>

I almost skipped this challenge but then remembered this cute set from My Favorite Things and decided I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go. It&amp;rsquo;s not really my &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I pushed myself a little.</description>

I always struggle with masculine cards. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much for masculine images and I tend towards purples and reds in my colour selections. I will admit, I almost skipped this challenge! I was poking around Pinterest and searched for &amp;ldquo;masculine colour combinations&amp;rdquo; and something similar to what I used popped up.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the last challenge of the moth for CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. As it is the fifth challenge this month, we have both a sketch and a colour combination for you to use!
I will admit, I am not thrilled with my card. Maybe my border is too wide? It just feels like the Island Indigo overwhelms the rest of the card. The rest of the design team has inspiration for you HERE and I hope that you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us!</description>

I had another idea in my head for this card but I can&amp;rsquo;t hold a pen well enough to actually colour at the moment, so I had to scrap that idea and come up with something else.</description>

      <description>Happy Tuesday creative friends&amp;hellip; I saw my surgeon yesterday and as expected, the plaster splint was removed and I now have a removable brace. I can wear the brace when I&amp;rsquo;m up and about or if the arm/wrist is fatigued. I have some stretches thatI&amp;rsquo;ve started doing that are really tough but I am told it will all get easier&amp;hellip; I am to use my arm and wrist as tolerated for anything non-weight bearing.</description>

Someone posted about an easy interactive card idea that Jennifer McGuire did a video on&amp;hellip; so I watched the video and decided to give it a try.</description>

      <description>Let me tell you how long it takes me type up a blog post using only my left hand! Most of my jobs over the years have been keyboard-centric so I am a fast typer&amp;hellip; in fact, I enjoy typing&amp;hellip; but this one handed thing is frustrating!!!
If only I had a dictation app on my laptop&amp;hellip;
Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge with the team ay Addicted to CAS.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations April challenge! We&amp;rsquo;d love to see your Christmas cards using plaid or tartan!
When plaid first started being popular (again), I resisted it. I honestly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan. But over the years it&amp;rsquo;s grown on me! There&amp;rsquo;s just something about a good old red and black buffalo check&amp;hellip;.
I had fun with some Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up plaid papers and the L&amp;rsquo;il Gnome from Simon Says Stamp</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really missing my creative space now&amp;hellip; I had surgery on my right wrist yesterday and am hoping things will start to feel better again soon. I&amp;rsquo;m only sharing design team creations now as typing blog posts is very slow with only one hand.
It&amp;rsquo;s Saturday so it&amp;rsquo;s time for another challenge with the team ay Simply Less is More&amp;hellip;
I focussed my one layer card on the bottom of my card.</description>

      <description>Good morning friends&amp;hellip;. the challenge at Time Out Challenges is spring! I love spring and how the world seems to come back to life. I chose butterflies as they will be gracing our gardens soon!
I played with some white embossed Pink Fresh Studio butterflies and the awesome Birthday Brights rainbow paper from MFT on a slimline card.</description>

      <description>As I did have some cards created for the design teams I&amp;rsquo;m on before I broke my wrist last week, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d still blog them. Typing is slow with only one hand!v I am so sad to not be creating&amp;hellip; I was on track to have a record breaking number of cards made. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone fore more than 3 or 4 days without making cards in many weeks.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another clean and simple challenge with the team at AAACards. Our challenge for the next two weeks is &amp;ldquo;small and few&amp;rdquo; with the optional twist of Easter or Spring. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us by sharing your clean and simple creations with us HERE!
I did a quick and easy card thanks to this wonderful Lawn Fawn strip of flowers. I stamped them, coloured them quickly with a few spring colours of Copics, stamped my greeting and then put the flowers on the card with some foam adhesive.</description>

      <description>The team at Addicted to CAS is playing with just one layer for challenge #218. To me, a one layer card means there is no other cardstock on the card other than the card itself. You can add a few embellishments (pearls if you need to) but there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any layers or dies (unless you do an inlaid technique). It&amp;rsquo;s a difficult thing to do&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get depth and movement.</description>

      <description>Happy Tuesday crafty friends&amp;hellip; the team at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches is back with another sketch challenge to inspire you. We really hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along and share your creations with us HERE!
I stamped up a sheet of those wonderful Pink Fresh Studio butterflies and embossed them in white this time. I used a finger dauber to add colour to this butterfly after I&amp;rsquo;d cut it out, trying to keep colours in specific areas&amp;hellip; it helped that I used similar colours.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with the team at Less is More. As you can see from the graphic below, the prompt is &amp;ldquo;occupations&amp;rdquo;. As always, we hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with our challenge and share your creations with us HERE!
I struggled a bit with the challenge as I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any stamps that scream &amp;ldquo;occupations&amp;rdquo; to me&amp;hellip; so I had to think outside the box a little.</description>

      <description>Bhavya is the host at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches for the month of April. She has chosen a great &amp;lsquo;garden&amp;rsquo; themed set of colours for us to use as her first colour challenge this month. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how others interpret these colours!
For our colour challenges, you must use all of the stated challenge colours. You may also use neutral colours; however, the challenge colours should be the most noticeable ones featured on your card.</description>

When I saw the cue card for this challenge, my mind automatically went to animals&amp;hellip;. but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of cards with animals on them in the last little bit and I was a little tired of them.</description>
