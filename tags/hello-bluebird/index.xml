      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the month which means there is a new CASology challenge. Our cue for this month is HAPPY!
The cue is easy for me as the majority of the cards I make are for birthdays&amp;hellip; I pulled out some rainbow colours and an alphabet die set and created this for you!
Card Info
Cardstock: Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Basic Black, Poppy Parade, Daffodil Delight, Granny Apple Green, Pacific Point, Highland Heather</description>

      <description>Another quick post from me as I am dealing with a seized muscle in my back and sitting at my desk might kill me&amp;hellip; thankfully I have a few cards made and ready to share since I can&amp;rsquo;t sit here long enough to craft (and creating while in pain isn&amp;rsquo;t easy&amp;hellip; creativity doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow)
I have a die by Pink Fresh that does slimline strips and I like to use that when making thin strips because I know they will be accurate.</description>
