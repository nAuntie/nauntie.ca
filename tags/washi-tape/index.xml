      <description>I am running out of cards to share with you! I lost some time with card making first with my broken wrist in the spring and then again in August with Covid. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty good these days but I feel like life has been busy and the mojo is harder to come by! I sit at my craft desk but get nothing accomplished! I hope my creative block doesn&amp;rsquo;t last too long!</description>

      <description>The new challenge at Less is More is to use vellum. There are so many different ways to use vellum in your creations and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what you all come up with! I had a few ideas in my head about how I wanted to use vellum and I decided I wanted to try foiling on it to see if it would work. I&amp;rsquo;m here to report that it works pretty well, although there are some splotchy spots so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend doing anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t line art or sentiments.</description>

      <description>I find myself always leaning towards the same layouts when I am using a circle element on my card (and squares too) so I consciously made an effort to do something different with this rainbow floral wreath.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back without another washi tape creation. The stamp and die with this Pink Fresh Studio set are one piece so it makes more sense to stamp it all and then cut it all&amp;hellip; the same goes with the washi tape. When I cut out the wreath for the card a few days ago, it only made sense to do it all. These were the other pieces I had so I threw them all on a panel to create a card.</description>

      <description>I had so much fun playing with ink on washi tape, that I decided to play again. This is a great technique. You just ink up the sticky side of the washi tape and put it down on your cardstock and then pull it up again. It really gives some fun texture to your card. This is great for me as I have some washi tapes that I will probably never use on cards so I can do something creative with it (instead of just using it as repositionable adhesive)</description>

      <description>Happy Sunday all&amp;hellip; in true Calgary fashion, our first long weekend of &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; has delivered us a mixed bag of weather. Friday it was really windy and wet and we had a little snow falling from the sky. Saturday was cool and mostly cloudy. So far this morning the sun is shining and it&amp;rsquo;s warming up a little. This is what you get with an elevation of 1045 m above sea level (that&amp;rsquo;s 3428 ft).</description>
