      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not honestly sure about this card&amp;hellip; it looks better in person than it does in this photo, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure about it. I had these white tulips cut out from a different project and had originally thought I&amp;rsquo;d blend ink on them. I had them laid out on a white piece of paper and I kind of liked how they looked so I went with it.

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of square cards&amp;hellip;. there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with them, they look great, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t stray from my usual size very often. But for some reason, when I was designing this card, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on a regular A2 card so I changed things up and LOVE how it looks on the square! I added two extra pieces from the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral Washi tape to the wreath for a little something &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I find myself always leaning towards the same layouts when I am using a circle element on my card (and squares too) so I consciously made an effort to do something different with this rainbow floral wreath.

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing a lot of crafting as my wrist has been sore again but I hope to sit in my craft room for a while today&amp;hellip; and maybe some mojo will flow.
Just a quick post from me today with more of those lovely Crafty Meraki tulips. </description>

      <description>Happy Friday the 13th crafty friends! If you&amp;rsquo;ve been here for a while, you know that my hubby and I celebrate Friday the 13th as we met (at a bar in the late 80s) on a Friday the 13th and got engaged on a Friday the 13th (our oldest son was born on the anniversary of the day Bruce proposed but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Friday). We&amp;rsquo;ve been married 31 years (or it will be on June 1) so we figure it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good day.</description>
