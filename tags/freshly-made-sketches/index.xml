      <description>I got home from work yesterday and sat down in my creative space, hoping to make a card. I saw the latest sketch at Freshly Made Sketches and decided to try my hand at it&amp;hellip; I really hope my mojo shows up on the rest of my days off this week&amp;hellip;

      <description>I had to play along with the latest challenge at Color Throwdown because I really love the look of blue and green together. I usually choose the brighter forms of these colours to go together but I strayed from that with this card to use up a scrap of very old patterned paper I had in my stash.

      <description>I found a little time before work yesterday to play along with the current challenge at Freshly Made Sketches.
I was able to use a piece I did with my Glimmer Hot Foil machine&amp;hellip;. used the solid foiling plate to use the left over foil from another project.

      <description>I loved the sketch the Cecile had for Freshly Made Sketches this week&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m glad I had a few minutes at my craft table to play along!
My card originally much more plain as I stamped directly on the larger white square and put the card together. The more I looked at it the more I knew it needed a little something more. I cut a smaller square and stamped on it then used my Perfect Layers tool to create a green border and then put it on top of what I had originally created&amp;hellip; and it looks SO much better in my opinion!</description>

      <description>I loved the ease of the sketch by Kim at Freshly Made Sketches this week. I combined the idea of using patterned paper with Kim&amp;rsquo;s idea of horizontal stripes to create my card. I also used a stamp and die that I bought YEARS ago that I&amp;rsquo;ve never used!

      <description>I was able to get myself caught up with design team duties and found a little time to play with some current challenges. Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the card I created for the latest sketch at Freshly Made Sketches.
I was able to grab this flower from my bin of extras to add a pop of colour to my black and white card.

      <description>Well *you* can&amp;rsquo;t see that this card says &amp;ldquo;wish big&amp;rdquo;, but it does. I used black ink on the blue cardstock and it&amp;rsquo;s really subtle but it&amp;rsquo;s there. I should have done something different, but honestly, the card was all put together when I decided to stamp on the strip. It was a bad decision LOL!
