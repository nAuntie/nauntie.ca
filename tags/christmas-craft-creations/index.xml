      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the latest challenge at Christmas Craft Creations! I sure hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along!
My winter activity is playing in the snow&amp;hellip;. you can see I had fun building an igloo and decorating it! In reality, I had more fun playing with my Glimmer Hot Foil Machine to create my snowy background LOL!

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the July theme of Patterned Paper at Christmas Craft Creations. This is a monthly challenge that helps you get at least one Christmas card made every month. The design team always has such wonderful creations&amp;hellip; you should check them out!
I got this one sheet of patterned paper at a garage sale and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know why I bought it. I don&amp;rsquo;t scrapbook and honestly the design on it is really not suited to cutting down for Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still some time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations June theme of TREES! This is a great challenge to help you get a few Christmas cards made throughout the year. I had promised myself to make more Christmas cards before October and while I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, it&amp;rsquo;s really only been for this challenge! Maybe I should make one day a month where I make only Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations April challenge! We&amp;rsquo;d love to see your Christmas cards using plaid or tartan!
When plaid first started being popular (again), I resisted it. I honestly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan. But over the years it&amp;rsquo;s grown on me! There&amp;rsquo;s just something about a good old red and black buffalo check&amp;hellip;.
I had fun with some Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up plaid papers and the L&amp;rsquo;il Gnome from Simon Says Stamp</description>
