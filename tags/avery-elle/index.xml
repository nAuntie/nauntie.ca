      <description>Why do the months of June, July and August seem to fly by while December, January and February go by at a snails pace? I am in awe that summer in already half over! I know there&amp;rsquo;s still lots of warm sunny weather to come, but it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s going by so fast!
I saw a card using this layout on Pinterest and wanted to play with it. For some it would still be considered clean and simple, but for others it is not.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another clean and simple challenge with the team at AAACards. Our challenge for the next two weeks is &amp;ldquo;small and few&amp;rdquo; with the optional twist of Easter or Spring. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us by sharing your clean and simple creations with us HERE!
I did a quick and easy card thanks to this wonderful Lawn Fawn strip of flowers. I stamped them, coloured them quickly with a few spring colours of Copics, stamped my greeting and then put the flowers on the card with some foam adhesive.</description>
