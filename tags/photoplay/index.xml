      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back today with another card following the October sketch at Build Your Stash Holiday Cardmakers. I really love this sketch and could see going back to it a lot to use up some of my patterned papers. Have you played along yet?
I made this one a little more simple with only one embossed layer and used a stamped image as the second panel. I might have cheated a bit with that.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new sketch challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. This is a great sketch to showcase a little bit of patterned paper or an embossed panel&amp;hellip; or keep it just a solid colour. There are so many options!
I saw this sketch and immediately wanted to use this beautiful Stampin&#39; Up! paper from last year. It took a while for me to decide what to do with the other element on the card but I landed on the gnome and I like how it turned out!</description>
