      <description>I am very excited to announce that I have joined the design team at the Build Your Stash Holiday Cardmakers blog!! This is an awesome sketch challenge blog that has a new sketch each month, encouraging you to create Christmas cards each month. I will be sharing two cards each month with the monthly sketch. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll check them out and join in the fun!
This is the sketch for October&amp;hellip; I LOVE that they include measurements!</description>
