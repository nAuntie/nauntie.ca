      <description>I found a little relief from my shoulder issue thanks to a visit to my physical therapist and a treatment of IMS. She uses accupuncture needles to poke in to the muscles to try to get them to release. I&amp;rsquo;m still hurting but not nearly as much as I have been over the last two weeks. I see her again early next week for another treatment&amp;hellip; until then I am trying to use my right arm &amp;ldquo;properly&amp;rdquo;, stretching, using heat and ice and trying to relax that arm as much as I can.</description>
