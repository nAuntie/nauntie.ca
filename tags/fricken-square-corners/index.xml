      <description>Back in early July we lost a very good friend after a short illness&amp;hellip; it was devastating to lose a friend that we loved so much. She was one of my regular customers in terms of card orders. Her husband approached me after her funeral, asking if I would please make him some thank you cards to send out to people who helped out so much during her brief illness and after her death&amp;hellip; and I said &amp;ldquo;of course&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The most difficult part of this card was getting the gold cord to look good&amp;hellip;. LOL! I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I like how it turned out but after about 12 minutes of fiddling with it, I decided to leave it alone.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge at Addicted to CAS today&amp;hellip; time to show us your clean and simple creations featuring the colour pink!
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I struggled with this prompt&amp;hellip;. but then I gabbed out some stencils and had a little play with them. I stencilled the pink swirls first and then put a second stencil on top of the first stencil and used Glimmer Paste so that the sparkly circles only showed up on the pink swirls.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches that starts today&amp;hellip;. these colours are PERFECT to use on a black background if you like that sort of popping neon appearance. We always love to see what others do with our sketches and colour combinations so I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along and share your card with us!
I absolutely LOVE how some colours just POP off of a black background.</description>

      <description>I just love the 2022-24 Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours&amp;hellip;. but I don&amp;rsquo;t find I use all of them much. I am really drawn to the red, green and light blue but not the two darker colours as much. So I grabbed all five for this card.

      <description>I am back to work this afternoon after my week of isolation thanks to Covid. I am feeling really good except a lingering tiredness but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will get better with time. I really need to just take planned holidays from work instead of illness and injury!!
A friend asked for some thank you cards recently so I did up a few different designs for her. I really liked the look of using the last bit of ink on the blending brush to go over the white spots left behind by stencilling so I did a few like this one&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long week away from my creative space as I&amp;rsquo;ve been isolating in the main bedroom of our home because I got Covid. Honestly I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of energy some days so I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss the creative time all that much, but as I started to feel better I wished I could sit at my desk and play. I am now feeling better and out of isolation but wearing a mask when others are around.</description>

      <description>Why do the months of June, July and August seem to fly by while December, January and February go by at a snails pace? I am in awe that summer in already half over! I know there&amp;rsquo;s still lots of warm sunny weather to come, but it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s going by so fast!
I saw a card using this layout on Pinterest and wanted to play with it. For some it would still be considered clean and simple, but for others it is not.</description>

      <description>I really love this glitter paper from Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! It&amp;rsquo;s in all of the new In Color colours that I love and I love that I can use one tone of it or the ombre effect. It adds a great little &amp;ldquo;something extra&amp;rdquo; to my cards!

      <description>I will admit that I love stencils&amp;hellip; and I have a few dozen&amp;hellip; but I hardly use them because I feel intimidated by them. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I prefer the clean and simple style for my creations and stencils tend to be pretty busy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to pull them out to play with a little more often&amp;hellip; For this card I used the ink through the stencil and then the same colours of inks over top without the stencil to soften the look a little bit.</description>

      <description>The code word at Addicted to CAS is Nautical&amp;hellip; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along. The design team has created some fun ideas that you can see HERE.
I had a bit in my stash that would have been ok for this challenge but nothing that was speaking to me&amp;hellip; so I used some dies to create my nautical themed card instead.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a colour challenge at Simply Less is More&amp;hellip; and that challenge is traditional Christmas. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll dig out some of your Christmas stash and play along with us!
To me, the traditional colours of Christmas are red, green and gold&amp;hellip;. and I think &amp;ldquo;sparkle&amp;rdquo; should be a Christmas colour as well LOL! I just love sparkly things, especially for Christmas cards!

      <description>Another quick post from me as I am dealing with a seized muscle in my back and sitting at my desk might kill me&amp;hellip; thankfully I have a few cards made and ready to share since I can&amp;rsquo;t sit here long enough to craft (and creating while in pain isn&amp;rsquo;t easy&amp;hellip; creativity doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow)
I have a die by Pink Fresh that does slimline strips and I like to use that when making thin strips because I know they will be accurate.</description>

      <description>Good morning friends&amp;hellip; a quick post from me today to share my creations for the current CAS on Friday challenge. The current challenge is &amp;ldquo;silhouette&amp;rdquo; and instead of stamping, I did a black die cut instead. I used my Copics to create a little rainbow and then put the die cut floral spring on top of it. Because I used Copics, I used a smaller panel and put it on top of a white card so that the ink bleeding wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show through to the inside of the card.</description>

      <description>I love the inspiration photo from the current Color Throwdown challenge so I had to play along. But then I was stumped as to what I wanted to do&amp;hellip; I do much better with sketch challenges than colour challenges I think!
I pulled out a stencil I haven&amp;rsquo;t used yet and this is the result. I was going to orient my card the other way however the glitter paste made a mess in one area under the stencil so I flipped the panel and covered it with my sentiment!</description>

      <description>I loved the ease of the sketch by Kim at Freshly Made Sketches this week. I combined the idea of using patterned paper with Kim&amp;rsquo;s idea of horizontal stripes to create my card. I also used a stamp and die that I bought YEARS ago that I&amp;rsquo;ve never used!

      <description>The current challenge at CAS on Friday is to make a thank you card. I love these open daisies by A Jillian Vance Design. I paired them with some of the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours to create my card for the challenge.

      <description>I had fun with some light stencilling for my card today. I wanted some pretty colour without it being overwhelming. I love layering stencils since it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to do one colour at a time&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s achievable with a regular stencil but you have to be careful with the masking! I actually used two different stencils for this card but only used a small portion of each, moving it around to fill my background.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the last sketch challenge for the month of June with CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; our sketch this time is a slimline card and I went for a mini-slimline as I prefer that size.
I took, a large floral stamp but only used a part of it so it would fit on my card. I even pulled out my Copics to do a little colouring (which isn&amp;rsquo;t easy as my wrist heals)</description>

      <description>When you find a colour combination you just love, sometimes you have to go with it. That&amp;rsquo;s me with the colours blue and green&amp;hellip; specifically Tim Holtz Twisted Citron and Salty Ocean. Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Parakeet Party and Tahitian Tide are right up there for me too!
And of course, I get to play along one more time with the challenge at Color Hues
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve *ever* entered one challenge more than one time&amp;hellip; and this is my third entry!</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still some time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations June theme of TREES! This is a great challenge to help you get a few Christmas cards made throughout the year. I had promised myself to make more Christmas cards before October and while I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, it&amp;rsquo;s really only been for this challenge! Maybe I should make one day a month where I make only Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>Is it good or bad that this Pink Fresh Studio stamp is one stamp with several images that you stamp, stencil and cut all at once? It&amp;rsquo;s good because it&amp;rsquo;s easy, it&amp;rsquo;s bad because you get stuck with several cards that look similar.
The good news is that this is a LOVELY set and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to create with it! And I get to play along with Color Hues again!</description>

For the card today, I used the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral stamp, die and stencils&amp;hellip; but instead of using all of the layers of the stencil, I only used two to create the bit of blue on the flowers and the bit of green on the leaves.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Time Out Challenges&amp;hellip; up for grabs this week is a $25 credit at Top Flight Stamps! Play along with us by sharing your card HERE. Our prompt for this challenge is &amp;ldquo;tropical&amp;rdquo;.
I had some fun with the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Colours and an old stamp and die set. Some of the leaves are stamped, some are cut out&amp;hellip; I was able to create a little more dimension this way.</description>

      <description>I worked on this card a few weeks ago while my wrist was still pretty sore and useless (instead of kind of sore and useless like it is now) and decided to play with a design that featured patterned paper. Doing this made it all a little easier for me and my wrist but still allowed for me to feel like I was being creative.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back without another washi tape creation. The stamp and die with this Pink Fresh Studio set are one piece so it makes more sense to stamp it all and then cut it all&amp;hellip; the same goes with the washi tape. When I cut out the wreath for the card a few days ago, it only made sense to do it all. These were the other pieces I had so I threw them all on a panel to create a card.</description>

      <description>I saw a few cards on some Facebook groups I&amp;rsquo;m on as well as on Instagram, using the current challenge from Color Hues&amp;hellip; and while I don&amp;rsquo;t often reach for yellow, I really felt like I wanted to play along with this challenge. I love black and white with a pop of colour&amp;hellip; I usually do red, but yellow sure does look happy!

      <description>I pulled out a stencil that I purchased right before I broke my wrist. Ink blending still isn&amp;rsquo;t easy (and honestly it can hurt) but this was quick and I was able to get through it. I loved the look of the colours in the current Color Throwdown Challenge so that&amp;rsquo;s what I went with for this card.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at Less is More! We want to see your &amp;ldquo;masculine&amp;rdquo; themed cards for the next two weeks! Share them with us HERE!!!
I always struggle with masculine cards. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much for masculine images and I tend towards purples and reds in my colour selections. I will admit, I almost skipped this challenge! I was poking around Pinterest and searched for &amp;ldquo;masculine colour combinations&amp;rdquo; and something similar to what I used popped up.</description>

      <description>I was scrolling Pinterest yesterday and found a card sketch I liked&amp;hellip; clicked the link and found a new to me challenge page called Paper Craft Crew. I had a little mojo this morning so I decided to play with their sketch.
I dipped in to my bin of extra die cuts and put together this card&amp;hellip;

      <description>I was able to get myself caught up with design team duties and found a little time to play with some current challenges. Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the card I created for the latest sketch at Freshly Made Sketches.
I was able to grab this flower from my bin of extras to add a pop of colour to my black and white card.

      <description>Welcome to the last challenge of the moth for CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. As it is the fifth challenge this month, we have both a sketch and a colour combination for you to use!
I will admit, I am not thrilled with my card. Maybe my border is too wide? It just feels like the Island Indigo overwhelms the rest of the card. The rest of the design team has inspiration for you HERE and I hope that you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us!</description>

      <description>I had so much fun playing with ink on washi tape, that I decided to play again. This is a great technique. You just ink up the sticky side of the washi tape and put it down on your cardstock and then pull it up again. It really gives some fun texture to your card. This is great for me as I have some washi tapes that I will probably never use on cards so I can do something creative with it (instead of just using it as repositionable adhesive)</description>

I will admit, this sketch had me scratching my head for a little bit. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what I wanted to do. I was flipping through my bin of dies and saw the balloons and decided to see what I could come up with.</description>

      <description>Happy Sunday all&amp;hellip; in true Calgary fashion, our first long weekend of &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; has delivered us a mixed bag of weather. Friday it was really windy and wet and we had a little snow falling from the sky. Saturday was cool and mostly cloudy. So far this morning the sun is shining and it&amp;rsquo;s warming up a little. This is what you get with an elevation of 1045 m above sea level (that&amp;rsquo;s 3428 ft).</description>

      <description>I have guidelines (for myself, not for others) as to what a sympathy card should look like. I don&amp;rsquo;t judge what others create, but I do like to keep the cards I create simple and &amp;ldquo;toned down&amp;rdquo;. I needed a card for friends who recently suffered a loss and managed to create this card using some extras that were in my dish.

      <description>I had my first session at physical therapy yesterday and while things are better than they had been, I still feel like there is a very long way to go before this injury is a thing of the past. I will be working on stretches and trying to use my right hand/arm/wrist as normally as possible. There is still some swelling and the joint is extremely stiff. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a little discouraged as I write this because I just want this whole thing to be a memory.</description>

      <description>Happy Friday the 13th crafty friends! If you&amp;rsquo;ve been here for a while, you know that my hubby and I celebrate Friday the 13th as we met (at a bar in the late 80s) on a Friday the 13th and got engaged on a Friday the 13th (our oldest son was born on the anniversary of the day Bruce proposed but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Friday). We&amp;rsquo;ve been married 31 years (or it will be on June 1) so we figure it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good day.</description>

If only I had a dictation app on my laptop&amp;hellip;

      <description>This will be my last post with CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches until my wrist heals enough to craft again. My surgery on Friday went well and I&amp;rsquo;m in less pain than I was before surgery. I have no idea when I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do things with the right hand again&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m guessing I&amp;rsquo;ll have some answers after my surgical follow up on the 2nd.
But for today, my card using the current sketch at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; I wanted to leave my background white but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>This is the last of the cards using this stamp set&amp;hellip; at least for a few days. I will admit I did something else with a few of the dies a few days ago so there will be more coming. I hope I haven&amp;rsquo;t played with them too much in the last bit and will find that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pull the set out again!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with the team at Less is More. As you can see from the graphic below, the prompt is &amp;ldquo;occupations&amp;rdquo;. As always, we hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with our challenge and share your creations with us HERE!
I struggled a bit with the challenge as I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any stamps that scream &amp;ldquo;occupations&amp;rdquo; to me&amp;hellip; so I had to think outside the box a little.</description>

      <description>Bhavya is the host at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches for the month of April. She has chosen a great &amp;lsquo;garden&amp;rsquo; themed set of colours for us to use as her first colour challenge this month. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how others interpret these colours!
For our colour challenges, you must use all of the stated challenge colours. You may also use neutral colours; however, the challenge colours should be the most noticeable ones featured on your card.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my friend Bonnie and I went to one of our favourite local stamp stores after I was done work. I will admit I bought a few things I didn&amp;rsquo;t need&amp;hellip; but I am so happy I did! This fabulous floral set from Pink Fresh is perfect for my colouring preferences&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;ll see a few cards using this set in the next several days as I stamped them up at once and spent some time colouring.</description>

      <description>I just love these floral swag stamps and dies&amp;hellip; I stamped this one, coloured it and cut it out so that it could go over the edges of the layers I placed on the front of this card. Have I told you lately how much I LOVE my perfect layers tool to create those beautiful 1/16&amp;quot; borders???
Let me tell you about another tool I am in LOVE with lately. My friend at Calgary Laser Creations is a papercrafter at heart and she has created some acrylic tools to help you get your layers on even and straight.</description>
