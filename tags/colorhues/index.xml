      <description>When you find a colour combination you just love, sometimes you have to go with it. That&amp;rsquo;s me with the colours blue and green&amp;hellip; specifically Tim Holtz Twisted Citron and Salty Ocean. Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Parakeet Party and Tahitian Tide are right up there for me too!
And of course, I get to play along one more time with the challenge at Color Hues
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve *ever* entered one challenge more than one time&amp;hellip; and this is my third entry!</description>

      <description>Is it good or bad that this Pink Fresh Studio stamp is one stamp with several images that you stamp, stencil and cut all at once? It&amp;rsquo;s good because it&amp;rsquo;s easy, it&amp;rsquo;s bad because you get stuck with several cards that look similar.
The good news is that this is a LOVELY set and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to create with it! And I get to play along with Color Hues again!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling in the craft room in the last few days&amp;hellip; I sit there, wanting to create but nothing comes. Thankfully I have some cards already made to be able to share with you&amp;hellip; and it just so happens to fall in to the color challenge at Color Hues!
For the card today, I used the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral stamp, die and stencils&amp;hellip; but instead of using all of the layers of the stencil, I only used two to create the bit of blue on the flowers and the bit of green on the leaves.</description>

      <description>I saw a few cards on some Facebook groups I&amp;rsquo;m on as well as on Instagram, using the current challenge from Color Hues&amp;hellip; and while I don&amp;rsquo;t often reach for yellow, I really felt like I wanted to play along with this challenge. I love black and white with a pop of colour&amp;hellip; I usually do red, but yellow sure does look happy!
