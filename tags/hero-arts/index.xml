      <description>I found a little time earlier this week to play along with the current TAG challenge at CAS on Friday. I have had this idea in my head for a bit and finally put it together for this card. I wanted to do it with just the tag on the card front to keep it more CAS but it just didn&amp;rsquo;t look right&amp;hellip; I had this piece of embossed cardstock on my desk, the leftovers from a previous creation, so I tried it and loved it!</description>
