      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back today with another card following the October sketch at Build Your Stash Holiday Cardmakers. I really love this sketch and could see going back to it a lot to use up some of my patterned papers. Have you played along yet?
I made this one a little more simple with only one embossed layer and used a stamped image as the second panel. I might have cheated a bit with that.</description>

      <description>Hello again, crafty friends! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours and Sketches. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how you all create with the colours below!
I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before&amp;hellip; I struggled with these three colours. This was a new level of struggle for me. If I wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the design team, I probably would have passed it up. I just could not do anything that I liked with these colours.</description>

      <description>I took a few days off from blogging&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of non-design team cards to share and honestly haven&amp;rsquo;t been feeling very creative lately. I am in my creative space for a while today and after I post this card I hope to have a little mojo flowing to create some stuff to share with you. I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to find my own ideas and am not feeling inspired by any of the cards I&amp;rsquo;ve pinned and saved to try to put my own spin on them.</description>

      <description>This card is a mix of some extras fro my bin and some other things I cut especially for this card. I knew I wanted a wreath like card so I cut the knotted circle and then dug through my bin of extras for some flowers and leaves that might work. I then foiled my sentiment and cut it out to finish off the card.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; we have some wonderfully fall colours to challenge you with this week. I will admit I was even thinking about some Christmas card ideas when I was first looking at these colours.
I decided to create a fall wreath and added a little hot foiling to finish it off.

      <description>I had every intention of getting this post up yesterday but after a fall on Sunday (I missed the last step) I decided to take myself to Urgent Care yesterday before work. I managed to break the 5th metatarsal in my left foot and am now in a fancy boot/air cast. Sigh&amp;hellip;. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have bad luck I&amp;rsquo;d have no luck at all!
Anyway&amp;hellip; I found a new to me challenge and decided to play along!</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new sketch challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. This is a great sketch to showcase a little bit of patterned paper or an embossed panel&amp;hellip; or keep it just a solid colour. There are so many options!
I saw this sketch and immediately wanted to use this beautiful Stampin&#39; Up! paper from last year. It took a while for me to decide what to do with the other element on the card but I landed on the gnome and I like how it turned out!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a word prompt challenge at Time Out Challenges. We have a $25 gift card to Lawn Fawn up for grabs for one lucky player!!
This is such a beautiful quote by Maya Angelou&amp;hellip;. and it&amp;rsquo;s something I try to do when I&amp;rsquo;m at work. I work at the front desk of a chiropractic clinic and we often see people who are in a lot of pain. I try had to be a bright spot in their day, maybe help them feel a little better for a few minutes while they have to interact with me.</description>

      <description>I am playing along with the STRIPES challenge at CAS on Friday&amp;hellip;. this started out being a card for last weeks Freshly Made Sketches but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to finish it in time to play along with this. I also liked the stripes on the side instead of the bottom better so I switched things up!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the month which means there is a new CASology challenge. Our cue for this month is HAPPY!
The cue is easy for me as the majority of the cards I make are for birthdays&amp;hellip; I pulled out some rainbow colours and an alphabet die set and created this for you!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at Addicted to CAS. This challenge was difficult for me&amp;hellip;. because I don&amp;rsquo;t like birds! I have a few in my stash but they don&amp;rsquo;t really get used. But something different happened when the current Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! catalogue came out and I NEEDED these sweet bird stamps and the punch that goes with it!

      <description>I am running out of cards to share with you! I lost some time with card making first with my broken wrist in the spring and then again in August with Covid. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty good these days but I feel like life has been busy and the mojo is harder to come by! I sit at my craft desk but get nothing accomplished! I hope my creative block doesn&amp;rsquo;t last too long!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the 5th Tuesday of the month so we have a double challenge for you at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches! We&amp;rsquo;ve taken some retired Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! colours and an old sketch and want to see you combine the two to create something beautiful!
I had to move the sentiment on my card as it just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right floating up there in the left corner like in the sketch. I even made a square card, which I don&amp;rsquo;t do very often!</description>

      <description>Happy Monday crafty friends! I am playing along with the challenge at Perfectly CAS today that wants to see a CAS card with embossing. I love the look of a hint of dry embossing on my creations and my first thought was to add a little sweater texture to a Christmas card. I embossed an entire panel and used this strip for this card and the rest on the card I posted yesterday.</description>

      <description>I found a little time earlier this week to play along with the current TAG challenge at CAS on Friday. I have had this idea in my head for a bit and finally put it together for this card. I wanted to do it with just the tag on the card front to keep it more CAS but it just didn&amp;rsquo;t look right&amp;hellip; I had this piece of embossed cardstock on my desk, the leftovers from a previous creation, so I tried it and loved it!</description>

      <description>The most difficult part of this card was getting the gold cord to look good&amp;hellip;. LOL! I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I like how it turned out but after about 12 minutes of fiddling with it, I decided to leave it alone.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches that starts today&amp;hellip;. these colours are PERFECT to use on a black background if you like that sort of popping neon appearance. We always love to see what others do with our sketches and colour combinations so I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along and share your card with us!
I absolutely LOVE how some colours just POP off of a black background.</description>

      <description>I truly have a lot of patterned paper&amp;hellip; and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know why since it often doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit in to a clean and simple style! I think because it&amp;rsquo;s just so darn pretty! I go through periods where I use it a lot and periods where I don&amp;rsquo;t use it much. I think I need to go through a period where I don&amp;rsquo;t buy it.
Thanks so much to Nadine (@scrappinready on Instagram) for the inspiration!</description>

      <description>I just love the 2022-24 Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours&amp;hellip;. but I don&amp;rsquo;t find I use all of them much. I am really drawn to the red, green and light blue but not the two darker colours as much. So I grabbed all five for this card.

      <description>I am back to work this afternoon after my week of isolation thanks to Covid. I am feeling really good except a lingering tiredness but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will get better with time. I really need to just take planned holidays from work instead of illness and injury!!
A friend asked for some thank you cards recently so I did up a few different designs for her. I really liked the look of using the last bit of ink on the blending brush to go over the white spots left behind by stencilling so I did a few like this one&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the July theme of Patterned Paper at Christmas Craft Creations. This is a monthly challenge that helps you get at least one Christmas card made every month. The design team always has such wonderful creations&amp;hellip; you should check them out!
I got this one sheet of patterned paper at a garage sale and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know why I bought it. I don&amp;rsquo;t scrapbook and honestly the design on it is really not suited to cutting down for Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches! Two of these colours are not my favourites&amp;hellip; one of them I honestly only have two sheets of thanks to my friend Bonnie giving them to me! But I will admit&amp;hellip; this is a great colour combination and I am pretty happy with how my card turned out!
As I don&amp;rsquo;t have many Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! ink pads any more and I struggle with trying to find suitable matches with the inks I do have, most of my colour challenges will have cardstock as the colours instead.</description>

      <description>This card started out as an experiment&amp;hellip; I wanted to see what this aqua coloured paste would look like on black&amp;hellip; and let me tell you&amp;hellip; it looks fabulous! It looked so nice I had to make a card with it, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not my usual clean and simple style.

      <description>Another quick post from me as I am dealing with a seized muscle in my back and sitting at my desk might kill me&amp;hellip; thankfully I have a few cards made and ready to share since I can&amp;rsquo;t sit here long enough to craft (and creating while in pain isn&amp;rsquo;t easy&amp;hellip; creativity doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow)
I have a die by Pink Fresh that does slimline strips and I like to use that when making thin strips because I know they will be accurate.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for you to be inspired by words with the latest Time Out Challenge&amp;hellip; you can see the quote in the graphic below. Our sponsor for this challenge is Newton&amp;rsquo;s Nook&amp;hellip; if you share your card with us you&amp;rsquo;ll have a chance at winning a prize from them!
I read this quote over and over and over again and the word that stood out to me each time was &amp;ldquo;dream&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; so I made a &amp;ldquo;dreamy&amp;rdquo; card for you.</description>

      <description>I loved the sketch the Cecile had for Freshly Made Sketches this week&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m glad I had a few minutes at my craft table to play along!
My card originally much more plain as I stamped directly on the larger white square and put the card together. The more I looked at it the more I knew it needed a little something more. I cut a smaller square and stamped on it then used my Perfect Layers tool to create a green border and then put it on top of what I had originally created&amp;hellip; and it looks SO much better in my opinion!</description>

      <description>I had a bunch of extra white flowers sitting in my bin of extras (that makes it sound huge&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just a Gladware sandwich sized container) and I decided to colour them up with some soft ink blending to create a little wreath of flowers to go with this new sunburst embossing folder that I purchased.

      <description>I loved the ease of the sketch by Kim at Freshly Made Sketches this week. I combined the idea of using patterned paper with Kim&amp;rsquo;s idea of horizontal stripes to create my card. I also used a stamp and die that I bought YEARS ago that I&amp;rsquo;ve never used!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with Less is More&amp;hellip;. our cue word for challenge #468 is &amp;ldquo;emboss&amp;rdquo;. You can use any interpretation of the word in your clean and simple card.
I decided to go with an embossing folder for my card&amp;hellip; and I grabbed the etched butterflies from my pile of extras from the card I shared a few days ago as I think they look embossed as well.</description>

      <description>Good morning crafty friends&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with Addicted to CAS! We are playing with the code word GRID for this challenge. I will admit that I struggled with this challenge. I had no idea how to interpret this word. But then I remembered I had some patterned papers that had a grid-look to them&amp;hellip; and I went with the one that was more delicate looking to create my card for today.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still some time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations June theme of TREES! This is a great challenge to help you get a few Christmas cards made throughout the year. I had promised myself to make more Christmas cards before October and while I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, it&amp;rsquo;s really only been for this challenge! Maybe I should make one day a month where I make only Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>I am so happy that Samantha chose some of the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours for our challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches this week. I just love the new colours and especially these three! I really hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with this colour combination this week!
These colours are just so happy! They make me think of popsicles, and beach balls, and shovels and pails&amp;hellip; all those wonderfully fun things in the summer!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Time Out Challenges&amp;hellip; up for grabs this week is a $25 credit at Top Flight Stamps! Play along with us by sharing your card HERE. Our prompt for this challenge is &amp;ldquo;tropical&amp;rdquo;.
I had some fun with the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Colours and an old stamp and die set. Some of the leaves are stamped, some are cut out&amp;hellip; I was able to create a little more dimension this way.</description>

      <description>I worked on this card a few weeks ago while my wrist was still pretty sore and useless (instead of kind of sore and useless like it is now) and decided to play with a design that featured patterned paper. Doing this made it all a little easier for me and my wrist but still allowed for me to feel like I was being creative.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Addicted to CAS&amp;hellip; the code word for challenge #222 is DOTS! There are so many wonderfully fun ideas on the challenge blog by the design team&amp;hellip; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll go check them out. And then you need to create your own dotted masterpieces to share with us! I wanted to have some fun with the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours for 2022-2024&amp;hellip; so I used some old circle punches and cut out a bunch in three different colours.</description>

      <description>For my card today, I searched through the archives at CAS Colours and Sketches to find a sketch I wanted to play with &amp;hellip; this was challenge #426 which was a colour and sketch challenge, but I only used the sketch.
What you can&amp;rsquo;t see in this photo is that I used a piercing cover plate die on the black banner which adds a little visual interest

      <description>I created a quick card to play along with the current sketch at Freshly Made Sketches&amp;hellip; I had the card all put together and ready to photograph and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. So I used my stitched rectangle die to cut off the front of the card and layered it on to another card and I like it so much better. The extra panel and the stitched lines really helped to make this card.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back without another washi tape creation. The stamp and die with this Pink Fresh Studio set are one piece so it makes more sense to stamp it all and then cut it all&amp;hellip; the same goes with the washi tape. When I cut out the wreath for the card a few days ago, it only made sense to do it all. These were the other pieces I had so I threw them all on a panel to create a card.</description>

      <description>I saw a few cards on some Facebook groups I&amp;rsquo;m on as well as on Instagram, using the current challenge from Color Hues&amp;hellip; and while I don&amp;rsquo;t often reach for yellow, I really felt like I wanted to play along with this challenge. I love black and white with a pop of colour&amp;hellip; I usually do red, but yellow sure does look happy!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at Less is More! We want to see your &amp;ldquo;masculine&amp;rdquo; themed cards for the next two weeks! Share them with us HERE!!!
I always struggle with masculine cards. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much for masculine images and I tend towards purples and reds in my colour selections. I will admit, I almost skipped this challenge! I was poking around Pinterest and searched for &amp;ldquo;masculine colour combinations&amp;rdquo; and something similar to what I used popped up.</description>

      <description>I was able to get myself caught up with design team duties and found a little time to play with some current challenges. Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the card I created for the latest sketch at Freshly Made Sketches.
I was able to grab this flower from my bin of extras to add a pop of colour to my black and white card.

      <description>Welcome to the last challenge of the moth for CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. As it is the fifth challenge this month, we have both a sketch and a colour combination for you to use!
I will admit, I am not thrilled with my card. Maybe my border is too wide? It just feels like the Island Indigo overwhelms the rest of the card. The rest of the design team has inspiration for you HERE and I hope that you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us!</description>

      <description>Well *you* can&amp;rsquo;t see that this card says &amp;ldquo;wish big&amp;rdquo;, but it does. I used black ink on the blue cardstock and it&amp;rsquo;s really subtle but it&amp;rsquo;s there. I should have done something different, but honestly, the card was all put together when I decided to stamp on the strip. It was a bad decision LOL!

      <description>Happy Friday crafty friends&amp;hellip; I thought a bright and happy card might help my mood. It&amp;rsquo;s been 6 weeks since the fall that broke my wrist and I am feeling frustrated at how much pain and limited mobility I still have. I see my surgeon on Monday and will talk about trying to get back to work which will be good&amp;hellip; but even then I think going back to work will be a few hours a few days a week.</description>

      <description>I had so much fun playing with ink on washi tape, that I decided to play again. This is a great technique. You just ink up the sticky side of the washi tape and put it down on your cardstock and then pull it up again. It really gives some fun texture to your card. This is great for me as I have some washi tapes that I will probably never use on cards so I can do something creative with it (instead of just using it as repositionable adhesive)</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we&amp;rsquo;re looking at the end of May already&amp;hellip; next week we&amp;rsquo;ll be in to June! It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that the weather hasn&amp;rsquo;t been consistently warm here in Calgary so I haven&amp;rsquo;t switched the furnace from heat to cool. It&amp;rsquo;s sad, really.
I really love the look of this pretty blue with the white flowers on top&amp;hellip; I added a little yellow to make it all pop!

I will admit, this sketch had me scratching my head for a little bit. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what I wanted to do. I was flipping through my bin of dies and saw the balloons and decided to see what I could come up with.</description>

      <description>Before I broke my wrist, I played along with the April 2022 Sheetload of Cards&amp;hellip; The way it worked out trying to make one card, it made more sense to make two since what I cut off was exactly what I needed for the second piece. These two cards are the same, but different
I really do love the size of a mini slimline!

      <description>I have guidelines (for myself, not for others) as to what a sympathy card should look like. I don&amp;rsquo;t judge what others create, but I do like to keep the cards I create simple and &amp;ldquo;toned down&amp;rdquo;. I needed a card for friends who recently suffered a loss and managed to create this card using some extras that were in my dish.

I had another idea in my head for this card but I can&amp;rsquo;t hold a pen well enough to actually colour at the moment, so I had to scrap that idea and come up with something else.</description>

      <description>Hello crafty friends. I have been crafting a little bit as I find it is good therapy. both mentally and physically. I am also working here and there without my splint on (which I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to do) and while I&amp;rsquo;m not typing as fast as I normally would, it&amp;rsquo;s not the one handed hunt and peck I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing in the last month. With things working a little more in my favour, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to blog more often again &amp;hellip; I still have cards to share that I created before my fall.</description>

      <description>Now that I have a little more mobility (and I do mean a little) with my right hand, I decided to try making a card on yesterday afternoon. Fine motor skills are still a bit of a struggle and I had to take a break part way through, but I managed to get a card done in time for the CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches challenge for this week. It&amp;rsquo;s a sketch challenge this week&amp;hellip; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us by sharing your clean and simple creations following the sketch below.</description>

      <description>Happy Tuesday creative friends&amp;hellip; I saw my surgeon yesterday and as expected, the plaster splint was removed and I now have a removable brace. I can wear the brace when I&amp;rsquo;m up and about or if the arm/wrist is fatigued. I have some stretches thatI&amp;rsquo;ve started doing that are really tough but I am told it will all get easier&amp;hellip; I am to use my arm and wrist as tolerated for anything non-weight bearing.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the Christmas Craft Creations April challenge! We&amp;rsquo;d love to see your Christmas cards using plaid or tartan!
When plaid first started being popular (again), I resisted it. I honestly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan. But over the years it&amp;rsquo;s grown on me! There&amp;rsquo;s just something about a good old red and black buffalo check&amp;hellip;.
I had fun with some Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up plaid papers and the L&amp;rsquo;il Gnome from Simon Says Stamp</description>

      <description>As I did have some cards created for the design teams I&amp;rsquo;m on before I broke my wrist last week, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d still blog them. Typing is slow with only one hand!v I am so sad to not be creating&amp;hellip; I was on track to have a record breaking number of cards made. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone fore more than 3 or 4 days without making cards in many weeks.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Tuesday, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with CAS Colours and Sketches. As it is the fifth Tuesday of a month, our challenge is a double&amp;hellip; Jeanne has chosen a past sketch and some retired colours to play with this week! Please make sure to have these three colours as the prominent colours of your clean and simple creation (but you can add neutrals as well). You are welcome to flip or rotate the sketch as long as the essence of the sketch remains.</description>

      <description>I reached in to the bin of extras for the card today&amp;hellip; a little strip of patterned paper, an even smaller strip of cardstock and some flowers I&amp;rsquo;d cut out for something else. I love it when these cards can come together like this.
That strip of bright green cardstock was literally in my recycling bin&amp;hellip;.. it was a long skinny strip that I trimmed off for another card and I just made it the right length for the front of the card.</description>
