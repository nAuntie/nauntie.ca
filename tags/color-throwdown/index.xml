      <description>I had to play along with the latest challenge at Color Throwdown because I really love the look of blue and green together. I usually choose the brighter forms of these colours to go together but I strayed from that with this card to use up a scrap of very old patterned paper I had in my stash.

      <description>I love the inspiration photo from the current Color Throwdown challenge so I had to play along. But then I was stumped as to what I wanted to do&amp;hellip; I do much better with sketch challenges than colour challenges I think!
I pulled out a stencil I haven&amp;rsquo;t used yet and this is the result. I was going to orient my card the other way however the glitter paste made a mess in one area under the stencil so I flipped the panel and covered it with my sentiment!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m playing along with the current challenge at Color Throwdown. I loved the look of the inspiration photo!
I have seen a few people do this idea of layering their die cuts to show the rainbow of colour&amp;hellip; it was harder to do than I expected, but I think it turned out OK!

      <description>I pulled out a stencil that I purchased right before I broke my wrist. Ink blending still isn&amp;rsquo;t easy (and honestly it can hurt) but this was quick and I was able to get through it. I loved the look of the colours in the current Color Throwdown Challenge so that&amp;rsquo;s what I went with for this card.
