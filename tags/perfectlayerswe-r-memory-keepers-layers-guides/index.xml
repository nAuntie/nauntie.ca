      <description>Good morning crafty friends&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a holiday Monday here in Calgary as we celebrated Thanksgiving with family and lots of food this past weekend. I am always off on Mondays (our office is closed on Sunday and Monday) but there was no alarm clocks for anyone in our house this morning. Always a good thing!
For my card today, I combined some of my favourite things&amp;hellip; my favourite colour, black and white stripes and a dais.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not honestly sure about this card&amp;hellip; it looks better in person than it does in this photo, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure about it. I had these white tulips cut out from a different project and had originally thought I&amp;rsquo;d blend ink on them. I had them laid out on a white piece of paper and I kind of liked how they looked so I went with it.

      <description>Hello again, crafty friends! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours and Sketches. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how you all create with the colours below!
I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before&amp;hellip; I struggled with these three colours. This was a new level of struggle for me. If I wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the design team, I probably would have passed it up. I just could not do anything that I liked with these colours.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge at Addicted to CAS that starts today. The code word is Autumn. Play along with us by sharing you clean and simple cards HERE!
I had fun doing a little ink blending on a piece of cardstock and then stamping and cutting out these fun leaves. I don&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of brown in my cards but an autumn theme and these colours called for some brown.</description>

      <description>How on earth is it the end of September already? I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling to write the word September at work and now, tomorrow, I have to write October?! We&amp;rsquo;ve had a great month here weatherwise and so far haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any snow fly (we often get the first snow in September). We actually hit 28C (82F) earlier this week which is unheard of at this time of year! I worry that winter will be a lot less kind than fall has been so far!</description>

      <description>I absolutely love the sketch this week at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches! My card went together pretty quickly once I decided on what elements I wanted to use. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us!
My card uses a few pieces from my bin of extras that I kept overlooking. I had used just two of the layering stencils and these two pieces had very little colour on them&amp;hellip; so I grabbed my Copics and gave them a bit more colour before adding them to my card.</description>

This is such a lovely image to get inspiration from. I used the tree along the side of the photo along with some silver and grey for my inspiration

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new colour challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; we have some wonderfully fall colours to challenge you with this week. I will admit I was even thinking about some Christmas card ideas when I was first looking at these colours.
I decided to create a fall wreath and added a little hot foiling to finish it off.

      <description>We have a colour challenge for you at AAACards this week&amp;hellip; with the optional twist of spots and dots. Use the graphic below to get your colour inspiration for your clean and simple cards.
The colours were a bit tough for me because while they look fine on this graphic, I had trouble getting them together on a card. I tried three different things before this one stuck&amp;hellip;

      <description>Have today off after picking up my coworkers shift on Tuesday. Feels strange. I do go back for a half day tomorrow. I am off in a few minutes for a massage and to head to one of my favourite creative stores to pick up a few things I ordered. A few other things might also make it in to my basket! I hope to come home and create as I&amp;rsquo;m way behind!</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new sketch challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. This is a great sketch to showcase a little bit of patterned paper or an embossed panel&amp;hellip; or keep it just a solid colour. There are so many options!
I saw this sketch and immediately wanted to use this beautiful Stampin&#39; Up! paper from last year. It took a while for me to decide what to do with the other element on the card but I landed on the gnome and I like how it turned out!</description>

      <description>One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t love about the Pink Fresh Studio washi tapes is that when you use them, you kind of need to use the entire panel which means you always end up with pieces you don&amp;rsquo;t need right away. These pieces go in to my bin of extras and I pull them out when I have a need for them. Sometimes it means I have several cards in a row that look similar.</description>

      <description>I am playing along with the STRIPES challenge at CAS on Friday&amp;hellip;. this started out being a card for last weeks Freshly Made Sketches but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to finish it in time to play along with this. I also liked the stripes on the side instead of the bottom better so I switched things up!

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new host this month at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; Patricia has chosen these fun colours to play with this week! I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along!
As you will often see me say, I struggled with these colours. I don&amp;rsquo;t often put yellow on a card and certainly not with these other colours! I wanted to play with ink for this challenge so I had to pull some similar colours from my stash and I added the Mango Melody in a layer.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at Addicted to CAS. This challenge was difficult for me&amp;hellip;. because I don&amp;rsquo;t like birds! I have a few in my stash but they don&amp;rsquo;t really get used. But something different happened when the current Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! catalogue came out and I NEEDED these sweet bird stamps and the punch that goes with it!

This is one of those cards&amp;hellip;. I keep pushing it back to share because I&amp;rsquo;m just not thrilled with it.</description>

      <description>Happy Monday crafty friends! I am playing along with the challenge at Perfectly CAS today that wants to see a CAS card with embossing. I love the look of a hint of dry embossing on my creations and my first thought was to add a little sweater texture to a Christmas card. I embossed an entire panel and used this strip for this card and the rest on the card I posted yesterday.</description>

      <description>I found a little time earlier this week to play along with the current TAG challenge at CAS on Friday. I have had this idea in my head for a bit and finally put it together for this card. I wanted to do it with just the tag on the card front to keep it more CAS but it just didn&amp;rsquo;t look right&amp;hellip; I had this piece of embossed cardstock on my desk, the leftovers from a previous creation, so I tried it and loved it!</description>

      <description>The most difficult part of this card was getting the gold cord to look good&amp;hellip;. LOL! I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I like how it turned out but after about 12 minutes of fiddling with it, I decided to leave it alone.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge at Addicted to CAS today&amp;hellip; time to show us your clean and simple creations featuring the colour pink!
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I struggled with this prompt&amp;hellip;. but then I gabbed out some stencils and had a little play with them. I stencilled the pink swirls first and then put a second stencil on top of the first stencil and used Glimmer Paste so that the sparkly circles only showed up on the pink swirls.</description>

      <description>I had to play along with the latest challenge at Color Throwdown because I really love the look of blue and green together. I usually choose the brighter forms of these colours to go together but I strayed from that with this card to use up a scrap of very old patterned paper I had in my stash.

      <description>I just love the 2022-24 Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours&amp;hellip;. but I don&amp;rsquo;t find I use all of them much. I am really drawn to the red, green and light blue but not the two darker colours as much. So I grabbed all five for this card.

      <description>I am back to work this afternoon after my week of isolation thanks to Covid. I am feeling really good except a lingering tiredness but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will get better with time. I really need to just take planned holidays from work instead of illness and injury!!
A friend asked for some thank you cards recently so I did up a few different designs for her. I really liked the look of using the last bit of ink on the blending brush to go over the white spots left behind by stencilling so I did a few like this one&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long week away from my creative space as I&amp;rsquo;ve been isolating in the main bedroom of our home because I got Covid. Honestly I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of energy some days so I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss the creative time all that much, but as I started to feel better I wished I could sit at my desk and play. I am now feeling better and out of isolation but wearing a mask when others are around.</description>

      <description>Why do the months of June, July and August seem to fly by while December, January and February go by at a snails pace? I am in awe that summer in already half over! I know there&amp;rsquo;s still lots of warm sunny weather to come, but it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s going by so fast!
I saw a card using this layout on Pinterest and wanted to play with it. For some it would still be considered clean and simple, but for others it is not.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s still time to play along with the July theme of Patterned Paper at Christmas Craft Creations. This is a monthly challenge that helps you get at least one Christmas card made every month. The design team always has such wonderful creations&amp;hellip; you should check them out!
I got this one sheet of patterned paper at a garage sale and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know why I bought it. I don&amp;rsquo;t scrapbook and honestly the design on it is really not suited to cutting down for Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>I will admit that I love stencils&amp;hellip; and I have a few dozen&amp;hellip; but I hardly use them because I feel intimidated by them. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I prefer the clean and simple style for my creations and stencils tend to be pretty busy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to pull them out to play with a little more often&amp;hellip; For this card I used the ink through the stencil and then the same colours of inks over top without the stencil to soften the look a little bit.</description>

I had a bit in my stash that would have been ok for this challenge but nothing that was speaking to me&amp;hellip; so I used some dies to create my nautical themed card instead.

      <description>My blog title has nothing to do with my card today&amp;hellip; but it has to do with what&amp;rsquo;s going on in my world. As you know, I broke my right wrist in April. While I am getting mobility and strength back in that wrist, it would appear that the muscles around my right shoulder don&amp;rsquo;t like that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the arm in awkward ways and they have now seized up making it near impossible to sit upright at my desk, let alone create.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a colour challenge at Simply Less is More&amp;hellip; and that challenge is traditional Christmas. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll dig out some of your Christmas stash and play along with us!
To me, the traditional colours of Christmas are red, green and gold&amp;hellip;. and I think &amp;ldquo;sparkle&amp;rdquo; should be a Christmas colour as well LOL! I just love sparkly things, especially for Christmas cards!

      <description>Another quick post from me as I am dealing with a seized muscle in my back and sitting at my desk might kill me&amp;hellip; thankfully I have a few cards made and ready to share since I can&amp;rsquo;t sit here long enough to craft (and creating while in pain isn&amp;rsquo;t easy&amp;hellip; creativity doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow)
I have a die by Pink Fresh that does slimline strips and I like to use that when making thin strips because I know they will be accurate.</description>

      <description>I loved the sketch the Cecile had for Freshly Made Sketches this week&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m glad I had a few minutes at my craft table to play along!
My card originally much more plain as I stamped directly on the larger white square and put the card together. The more I looked at it the more I knew it needed a little something more. I cut a smaller square and stamped on it then used my Perfect Layers tool to create a green border and then put it on top of what I had originally created&amp;hellip; and it looks SO much better in my opinion!</description>

      <description>I love the inspiration photo from the current Color Throwdown challenge so I had to play along. But then I was stumped as to what I wanted to do&amp;hellip; I do much better with sketch challenges than colour challenges I think!
I pulled out a stencil I haven&amp;rsquo;t used yet and this is the result. I was going to orient my card the other way however the glitter paste made a mess in one area under the stencil so I flipped the panel and covered it with my sentiment!</description>

      <description>I loved the ease of the sketch by Kim at Freshly Made Sketches this week. I combined the idea of using patterned paper with Kim&amp;rsquo;s idea of horizontal stripes to create my card. I also used a stamp and die that I bought YEARS ago that I&amp;rsquo;ve never used!

      <description>I had fun with some light stencilling for my card today. I wanted some pretty colour without it being overwhelming. I love layering stencils since it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to do one colour at a time&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s achievable with a regular stencil but you have to be careful with the masking! I actually used two different stencils for this card but only used a small portion of each, moving it around to fill my background.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for the last sketch challenge for the month of June with CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches&amp;hellip; our sketch this time is a slimline card and I went for a mini-slimline as I prefer that size.
I took, a large floral stamp but only used a part of it so it would fit on my card. I even pulled out my Copics to do a little colouring (which isn&amp;rsquo;t easy as my wrist heals)</description>

I have seen a few people do this idea of layering their die cuts to show the rainbow of colour&amp;hellip; it was harder to do than I expected, but I think it turned out OK!

And of course, I get to play along one more time with the challenge at Color Hues

In Color colours for our challenge at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches this week. I just love the new colours and especially these three! I really hope you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with this colour combination this week!
These colours are just so happy! They make me think of popsicles, and beach balls, and shovels and pails&amp;hellip; all those wonderfully fun things in the summer!</description>

      <description>Is it good or bad that this Pink Fresh Studio stamp is one stamp with several images that you stamp, stencil and cut all at once? It&amp;rsquo;s good because it&amp;rsquo;s easy, it&amp;rsquo;s bad because you get stuck with several cards that look similar.
The good news is that this is a LOVELY set and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to create with it! And I get to play along with Color Hues again!</description>

For the card today, I used the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral stamp, die and stencils&amp;hellip; but instead of using all of the layers of the stencil, I only used two to create the bit of blue on the flowers and the bit of green on the leaves.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Time Out Challenges&amp;hellip; up for grabs this week is a $25 credit at Top Flight Stamps! Play along with us by sharing your card HERE. Our prompt for this challenge is &amp;ldquo;tropical&amp;rdquo;.
I had some fun with the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! Colours and an old stamp and die set. Some of the leaves are stamped, some are cut out&amp;hellip; I was able to create a little more dimension this way.</description>

      <description>I worked on this card a few weeks ago while my wrist was still pretty sore and useless (instead of kind of sore and useless like it is now) and decided to play with a design that featured patterned paper. Doing this made it all a little easier for me and my wrist but still allowed for me to feel like I was being creative.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge at Addicted to CAS&amp;hellip; the code word for challenge #222 is DOTS! There are so many wonderfully fun ideas on the challenge blog by the design team&amp;hellip; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll go check them out. And then you need to create your own dotted masterpieces to share with us! I wanted to have some fun with the new Stampin&amp;rsquo; Up! In Color colours for 2022-2024&amp;hellip; so I used some old circle punches and cut out a bunch in three different colours.</description>

      <description>For my card today, I searched through the archives at CAS Colours and Sketches to find a sketch I wanted to play with &amp;hellip; this was challenge #426 which was a colour and sketch challenge, but I only used the sketch.
What you can&amp;rsquo;t see in this photo is that I used a piercing cover plate die on the black banner which adds a little visual interest

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back without another washi tape creation. The stamp and die with this Pink Fresh Studio set are one piece so it makes more sense to stamp it all and then cut it all&amp;hellip; the same goes with the washi tape. When I cut out the wreath for the card a few days ago, it only made sense to do it all. These were the other pieces I had so I threw them all on a panel to create a card.</description>

      <description>I saw a few cards on some Facebook groups I&amp;rsquo;m on as well as on Instagram, using the current challenge from Color Hues&amp;hellip; and while I don&amp;rsquo;t often reach for yellow, I really felt like I wanted to play along with this challenge. I love black and white with a pop of colour&amp;hellip; I usually do red, but yellow sure does look happy!

      <description>I pulled out a stencil that I purchased right before I broke my wrist. Ink blending still isn&amp;rsquo;t easy (and honestly it can hurt) but this was quick and I was able to get through it. I loved the look of the colours in the current Color Throwdown Challenge so that&amp;rsquo;s what I went with for this card.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new clean and simple challenge at Less is More! We want to see your &amp;ldquo;masculine&amp;rdquo; themed cards for the next two weeks! Share them with us HERE!!!
I always struggle with masculine cards. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much for masculine images and I tend towards purples and reds in my colour selections. I will admit, I almost skipped this challenge! I was poking around Pinterest and searched for &amp;ldquo;masculine colour combinations&amp;rdquo; and something similar to what I used popped up.</description>

      <description>I was able to get myself caught up with design team duties and found a little time to play with some current challenges. Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the card I created for the latest sketch at Freshly Made Sketches.
I was able to grab this flower from my bin of extras to add a pop of colour to my black and white card.

      <description>Welcome to the last challenge of the moth for CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches. As it is the fifth challenge this month, we have both a sketch and a colour combination for you to use!
I will admit, I am not thrilled with my card. Maybe my border is too wide? It just feels like the Island Indigo overwhelms the rest of the card. The rest of the design team has inspiration for you HERE and I hope that you&amp;rsquo;ll play along with us!</description>

      <description>Happy Friday crafty friends&amp;hellip; I thought a bright and happy card might help my mood. It&amp;rsquo;s been 6 weeks since the fall that broke my wrist and I am feeling frustrated at how much pain and limited mobility I still have. I see my surgeon on Monday and will talk about trying to get back to work which will be good&amp;hellip; but even then I think going back to work will be a few hours a few days a week.</description>

      <description>I had so much fun playing with ink on washi tape, that I decided to play again. This is a great technique. You just ink up the sticky side of the washi tape and put it down on your cardstock and then pull it up again. It really gives some fun texture to your card. This is great for me as I have some washi tapes that I will probably never use on cards so I can do something creative with it (instead of just using it as repositionable adhesive)</description>

I will admit, this sketch had me scratching my head for a little bit. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what I wanted to do. I was flipping through my bin of dies and saw the balloons and decided to see what I could come up with.</description>

      <description>Happy Sunday all&amp;hellip; in true Calgary fashion, our first long weekend of &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; has delivered us a mixed bag of weather. Friday it was really windy and wet and we had a little snow falling from the sky. Saturday was cool and mostly cloudy. So far this morning the sun is shining and it&amp;rsquo;s warming up a little. This is what you get with an elevation of 1045 m above sea level (that&amp;rsquo;s 3428 ft).</description>

      <description>I had my first session at physical therapy yesterday and while things are better than they had been, I still feel like there is a very long way to go before this injury is a thing of the past. I will be working on stretches and trying to use my right hand/arm/wrist as normally as possible. There is still some swelling and the joint is extremely stiff. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a little discouraged as I write this because I just want this whole thing to be a memory.</description>

      <description>Happy Friday the 13th crafty friends! If you&amp;rsquo;ve been here for a while, you know that my hubby and I celebrate Friday the 13th as we met (at a bar in the late 80s) on a Friday the 13th and got engaged on a Friday the 13th (our oldest son was born on the anniversary of the day Bruce proposed but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Friday). We&amp;rsquo;ve been married 31 years (or it will be on June 1) so we figure it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good day.</description>

I struggled a bit with the challenge as I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any stamps that scream &amp;ldquo;occupations&amp;rdquo; to me&amp;hellip; so I had to think outside the box a little.</description>

      <description>Bhavya is the host at CAS Colours &amp;amp; Sketches for the month of April. She has chosen a great &amp;lsquo;garden&amp;rsquo; themed set of colours for us to use as her first colour challenge this month. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how others interpret these colours!

      <description>A few weeks ago my friend Bonnie and I went to one of our favourite local stamp stores after I was done work. I will admit I bought a few things I didn&amp;rsquo;t need&amp;hellip; but I am so happy I did! This fabulous floral set from Pink Fresh is perfect for my colouring preferences&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;ll see a few cards using this set in the next several days as I stamped them up at once and spent some time colouring.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Tuesday, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new challenge with CAS Colours and Sketches. As it is the fifth Tuesday of a month, our challenge is a double&amp;hellip; Jeanne has chosen a past sketch and some retired colours to play with this week! Please make sure to have these three colours as the prominent colours of your clean and simple creation (but you can add neutrals as well). You are welcome to flip or rotate the sketch as long as the essence of the sketch remains.</description>

      <description>I am so often in awe at how fast time flies by. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that we&amp;rsquo;re at the end of March already. Here in Calgary that means that the weather is unpredictable. It can be sunny and warm one day and snowing the next. Today is cloudy and cool but there is no snow on the ground&amp;hellip; so I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy about that.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to use products that I don&amp;rsquo;t tent to grab for regularly&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some ink blending playing with some alcohol inks too.</description>

      <description>I just love these floral swag stamps and dies&amp;hellip; I stamped this one, coloured it and cut it out so that it could go over the edges of the layers I placed on the front of this card. Have I told you lately how much I LOVE my perfect layers tool to create those beautiful 1/16&amp;quot; borders???
Let me tell you about another tool I am in LOVE with lately. My friend at Calgary Laser Creations is a papercrafter at heart and she has created some acrylic tools to help you get your layers on even and straight.</description>
