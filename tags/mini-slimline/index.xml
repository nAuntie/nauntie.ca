      <description>Before I broke my wrist, I played along with the April 2022 Sheetload of Cards&amp;hellip; The way it worked out trying to make one card, it made more sense to make two since what I cut off was exactly what I needed for the second piece. These two cards are the same, but different
I really do love the size of a mini slimline!
