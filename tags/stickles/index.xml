      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back today with another card following the October sketch at Build Your Stash Holiday Cardmakers. I really love this sketch and could see going back to it a lot to use up some of my patterned papers. Have you played along yet?
I made this one a little more simple with only one embossed layer and used a stamped image as the second panel. I might have cheated a bit with that.</description>
