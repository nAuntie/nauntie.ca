For my card today, I searched through the archives at [CAS Colours and
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2021/06/challenge-426-double-challenge.html)
to find a sketch I wanted to play with ...  this was challenge \#426
which was a colour and sketch challenge, but I only used the sketch.

What you can't see in this photo is that I used a piercing cover plate
die on the black banner which adds a little visual interest
