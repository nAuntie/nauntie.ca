There's a new one layer card challenge over at [Simply Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)...  a one layer card means
there are no other pieces of cardstock other than your card base. If you
want to use dies, they have to be inlaid.  For me, the best way to
achieve a one layer card is some simple stamping.

\*you may add words as well\*

  

I had a thought in my head but had trouble getting all of the pieces
together.  A die cut would have been so much easier LOL!  I found a two
step stamping leaf stamp in my stash and instead of trying to find two
colours of ink, I stamped off the ink of scrap before stamping the
inside of the leaves to create a new colour.
