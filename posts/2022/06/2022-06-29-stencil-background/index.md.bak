I had fun with some light stencilling for my card today.  I wanted some
pretty colour without it being overwhelming.  I love layering stencils
since it's so easy to do one colour at a time... it's achievable with a
regular stencil but you have to be careful with the masking!  I actually
used two different stencils for this card but only used a small portion
of each, moving it around to fill my background.
