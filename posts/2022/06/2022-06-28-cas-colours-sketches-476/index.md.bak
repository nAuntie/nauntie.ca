It's time for the last sketch challenge for the month of June with [CAS
Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/06/challenge-476-sketch.html)...
our sketch this time is a slimline card and I went for a mini-slimline
as I prefer that size.

I took, a large floral stamp but only used a part of it so it would fit
on my card.  I even pulled out my Copics to do a little colouring (which
isn't easy as my wrist heals)
