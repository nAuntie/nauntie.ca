I pulled out a stencil that I purchased right before I broke my wrist. 
Ink blending still isn't easy (and honestly it can hurt) but this was
quick and I was able to get through it.  I loved the look of the colours
in the current [Color Throwdown
Challenge](https://colorthrowdown.blogspot.com/2022/06/color-throwdown-695.html)
so that's what I went with for this card.
