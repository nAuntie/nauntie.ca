I saw a few cards on some Facebook groups I'm on as well as on
Instagram, using the current challenge from [Color
Hues](http://colorhuesthecolorchallenge.blogspot.com/2022/06/color-hues-42-black-and-yellow.html)...
and while I don't often reach for yellow,  I really felt like I wanted
to play along with this challenge.  I love black and white with a pop of
colour... I usually do red, but yellow sure does look happy!
