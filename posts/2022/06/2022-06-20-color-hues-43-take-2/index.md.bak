Is it good or bad that this Pink Fresh Studio stamp is one stamp with
several images that you stamp, stencil and cut all at once?  It's good
because it's easy, it's bad because you get stuck with several cards
that look similar.

The good news is that this is a LOVELY set and it's easy to create with
it! And I get to play along with Color Hues again!
