I worked on this card a few weeks ago while my wrist was still pretty
sore and useless (instead of kind of sore and useless like it is now)
and decided to play with a design that featured patterned paper.  Doing
this made it all a little easier for me and my wrist but still allowed
for me to feel like I was being creative.
