I've been struggling in the craft room in the last few days... I sit
there, wanting to create but nothing comes.  Thankfully I have some
cards already made to be able to share with you... and it just so
happens to fall in to the color challenge at [Color
Hues](http://colorhuesthecolorchallenge.blogspot.com/2022/06/color-hues-43-blue-and-green.html)!

For the card today, I used the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral stamp,
die and stencils... but instead of using all of the layers of the
stencil, I only used two to create the bit of blue on the flowers and
the bit of green on the leaves.  I really like this look (and use it all
the time with the Altenew layering stamp sets I own).
