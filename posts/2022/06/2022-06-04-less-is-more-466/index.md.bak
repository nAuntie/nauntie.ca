It's time for a new clean and simple challenge at [Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)!  We want to see your
"masculine" themed cards for the next two weeks!  Share them with us
[HERE](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)!!!

I **always** struggle with masculine cards.  I don't have much for
masculine images and I tend towards purples and reds in my colour
selections.  I will admit, I almost skipped this challenge!  I was
poking around Pinterest and searched for "masculine colour combinations"
and something similar to what I used popped up.   I figured I could find
a way to use those colours in a more graphic card and then remember this
Stampin' Up! set I bought but hadn't really used.  In the end, while I
don't LOVE this card, I do think it's pretty good.
