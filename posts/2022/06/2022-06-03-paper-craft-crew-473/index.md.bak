I was scrolling Pinterest yesterday and found a card sketch I liked...
clicked the link and found a new to me challenge page called [Paper
Craft
Crew](https://papercraftcrew.com/pcc473-horizontal-sketch-challenge/). 
I had a little mojo this morning so I decided to play with their sketch.

I dipped in to my bin of extra die cuts and put together this card...
