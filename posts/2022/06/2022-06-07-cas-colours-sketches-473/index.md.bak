Samantha is the host for the month of June at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/06/challenge-473-colour.html)
and she chose some great colours for our first challenge of the month! 
For our colour challenges, you must use all of the stated challenge
colours. You may also use neutral colours; however, the challenge
colours should be the most noticeable ones featured on your card. We use
Stampin' Up colour names for reference, but you are welcome to use any
other companies' products as long as you match the challenge colours as
closely as possible.

Now Gorgeous Grape and Pear Pizzazz are totally in my wheelhouse... but
I really don't use a lot of any shade of yellow.   My first thought was
an iris or a pansy but I didn't have those stamps in my stash.  Instead
I turned to my Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow Floral stamps and stencils and
had some fun blending some colours.  I put three pieces together to
create my spray of flowers.
