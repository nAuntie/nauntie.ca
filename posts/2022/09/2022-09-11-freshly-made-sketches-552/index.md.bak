I got home from work yesterday and sat down in my creative space, hoping
to make a card.  I saw the latest sketch at [Freshly Made
Sketches](https://freshlymadesketches.blogspot.com/2022/09/freshly-made-sketches-552-sketch-by-jen.html)
and decided to try my hand  at it...  I really hope my mojo shows up on
the rest of my days off this week...
