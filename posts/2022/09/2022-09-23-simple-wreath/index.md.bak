This card is a mix of some extras fro my bin and some other things I cut
especially for this card.  I knew I wanted a wreath like card so I cut
the knotted circle and then dug through my bin of extras for some
flowers and leaves that might work.  I then foiled my sentiment and cut
it out to finish off the card.
