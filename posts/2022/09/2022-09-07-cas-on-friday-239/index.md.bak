I am playing along with the STRIPES challenge at [CAS on
Friday](http://cleanandsimpleonsunday.blogspot.com/2022/09/challenge-239-stripes.html).... 
this started out being a card for last weeks Freshly Made Sketches but I
didn't get a chance to finish it in time to play along with this.  I
also liked the stripes on the side instead of the bottom better so I
switched things up!
