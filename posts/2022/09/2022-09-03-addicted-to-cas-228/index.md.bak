It's time for a new clean and simple challenge at [Addicted to
CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/2022/09/challenge-228-birds.html).  

This challenge was difficult for me.... because I don't like birds!  I
have a few in my stash but they don't really get used.  But something
different happened when the current Stampin' Up! catalogue came out and
I NEEDED these sweet bird stamps and the punch that goes with it!
