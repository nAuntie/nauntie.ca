It's time for a new colour challenge at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/09/challenge-488-colors.html)...
we have some wonderfully fall colours to challenge you with this week. 
I will admit I was even thinking about some Christmas card ideas when I
was first looking at these colours.

I decided to create a fall wreath and added a little hot foiling to
finish it off.
