Back in early July we lost a very good friend after a short illness...
it was devastating to lose a friend that we loved so much.  She was one
of my regular customers in terms of card orders.  Her husband approached
me after her funeral, asking if I would please make him some thank you
cards to send out to people who helped out so much during her brief
illness and after her death... and I said "of course".

He had no guidelines for me, but I knew what I wanted to do.... I wanted
something subdued and something floral as Steph was a master gardener. 
This was the card I came up with.
