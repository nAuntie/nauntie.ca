How on earth is it the end of September already?  I'm still struggling
to write the word September at work and now, tomorrow, I have to write
October?!  We've had a great month here weatherwise and so far haven't
seen any snow fly (we often get the first snow in September).  We
actually hit 28C (82F) earlier this week which is unheard of at this
time of year!  I worry that winter will be a lot less kind than fall has
been so far!

I finally found a bit of mojo the other day and was able to create some
cards!  I am off work today and am hoping that Mr Mojo is at my craft
desk waiting for me again!
