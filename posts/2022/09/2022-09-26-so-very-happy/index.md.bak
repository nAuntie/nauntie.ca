I took a few days off from blogging...  I don't have a lot of non-design
team cards to share and honestly haven't been feeling very creative
lately.  I am in my creative space for a while today and after I post
this card I hope to have a little mojo flowing to create some stuff to
share with you.  I'm struggling to find my own ideas and am not feeling
inspired by any of the cards I've pinned and saved to try to put my own
spin on them.  Colour combos and sketches aren't inspiring me much
either.

I know it will come back... I just hate that it's gone!

This card was super simple...  some of the Stampin' Up! In Color 
sparkle paper cut with my Pink Fresh Studio strip dies, the MFT stitched
rectangle die and a pre-foiled sentiment from Pink Fresh Studio.
