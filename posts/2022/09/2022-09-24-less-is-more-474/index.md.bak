October 1st is World Cardmaking Day and here at [Less is
More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/), we are celebrating a
little early with a friendship themed challenge!  We think making a card
for a friend is a great way to celebrate World Cardmaking Day!  We hope
you'll play along!

I've got a couple of very good friends who are always there for me... to
listen, to provide support, to make me laugh, to distract me, to do
social things with... so I thought I'd make a card that I could give to
one of them.  I don't have a lot of close friends but I am very lucky to
have two very good friends that I know are always in my corner (and I am
always in theirs too!)
