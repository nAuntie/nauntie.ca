I had every intention of getting this post up yesterday but after a
fall on Sunday (I missed the last step) I decided to take myself to
Urgent Care yesterday before work.  I managed to break the 5th
metatarsal in my left foot and am now in a fancy boot/air cast. 
Sigh.... If I didn't have bad luck I'd have no luck at all!

Anyway... I found a new to me challenge and decided to play along!
