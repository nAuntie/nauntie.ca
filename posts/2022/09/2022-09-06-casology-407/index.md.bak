It's the first Tuesday of the month which means there is a new [CASology
challenge](http://casology.blogspot.com/).  Our cue for this month is
HAPPY!

The cue is easy for me as the majority of the cards I make are for
birthdays... I pulled out some rainbow colours and an alphabet die set
and created this for you!
