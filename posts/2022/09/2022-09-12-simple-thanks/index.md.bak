One thing I don't love about the Pink Fresh Studio washi tapes is that
when you use them, you kind of need to use the entire panel which means
you always end up with pieces you don't need right away.  These pieces
go in to my bin of extras and I pull them out when I have a need for
them.  Sometimes it means I have several cards in a row that look
similar.

For todays card, I pulled out my bin of extras... and I love how it
turned out!
