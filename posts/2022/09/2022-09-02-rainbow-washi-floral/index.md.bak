I am running out of cards to share with you!  I lost some time with
card making first with my broken wrist in the spring and then again in
August with Covid.  I'm feeling pretty good these days but I feel like
life has been busy and the mojo is harder to come by!  I sit at my craft
desk but get nothing accomplished!  I hope my creative block doesn't
last too long!
