Another card from the bin of extras....  

I used a die as a guide to draw a rectangle on my card front with
pencil... and then went over it a few times with a thin black marker,
not even trying to make straight lines.  Once it had set for a bit I
erased the pencil lines and then added in the hash marks and dots.  I
stamped my sentiment and added to my ink blended butterfly.

To create a little dimension, I added glue along the back of the
butterfly body and foam adhesive to the wings.  I held the body portion
against the cardstock until it dried to ensure it had a good stick.
