It is with some sadness that I am here with the final challenge at
[CASology.](http://casology.blogspot.com/).. after many years of
wonderful clean and simple challenges, Melissa has decided it is time to
retire the CASology Challenge.  I think it would be an awesome send off
to have a lot of cards submitted for this final challenge... an awesome
tribute to a great challenge and to a great team of inspiring CAS
creators.  I sure hope you'll share your CAS card with the cue of cozy
on the [CASology Blog](http://casology.blogspot.com/)!

I chose to create my favourite type of card for this challenge...  a
Christmas Card... with cozy wishes...
