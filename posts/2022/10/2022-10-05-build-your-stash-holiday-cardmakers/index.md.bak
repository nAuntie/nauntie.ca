I am very excited to announce that I have joined the design team at the
[Build Your Stash Holiday
Cardmakers](https://byshcardmakers.blogspot.com/) blog!!  This is an
awesome sketch challenge blog that has a new sketch each month,
encouraging you to create Christmas cards each month.  I will be sharing
two cards each month with the monthly sketch.  I hope you'll check them
out and join in the fun!

This is the sketch for October...  I LOVE that they include
measurements!!!

I honestly had planned on putting something on top of my top layer...
but this embossed pine cone and for limb was too perfect on it's own.  I
just couldn't cover it up!
