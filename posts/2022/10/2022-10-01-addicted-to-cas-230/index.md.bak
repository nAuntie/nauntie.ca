There's a new challenge at [Addicted to
CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) that starts today.  The code
word is Autumn.  Play along with us by sharing you clean and simple
cards [HERE](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)!

I had fun doing a little ink blending on a piece of cardstock and then
stamping and cutting out these fun leaves.  I don't use a lot of brown
in my cards but an autumn theme and these colours called for some
brown.  I like the red undertone of this cardstock.
