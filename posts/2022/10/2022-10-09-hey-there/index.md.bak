Good morning crafty friends... it's a holiday Monday here in Calgary as
we celebrated Thanksgiving with family and lots of food this past
weekend.  I am always off on Mondays (our office is closed on Sunday and
Monday) but there was no alarm clocks for anyone in our house this
morning.  Always a good thing!

For my card today, I combined some of my favourite things... my
favourite colour, black and white stripes and a dais.
