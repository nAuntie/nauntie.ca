I am loving my new Glimmer Foil Machine and I just know I'm going to
use it a lot during my Christmas card making season (which I think will
begin very shortly!).  The plate I used for this card is supposed to go
across the card to create "lights" but I liked how it gave a neat
background to play with going vertically instead.
