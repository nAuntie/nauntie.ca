Hello again, crafty friends!  It's time for a new colour challenge at
[CAS Colours and
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/10/challenge-490-colors.html). 
I can't wait to see how you all create with the colours below!

I've said it before... I struggled with these three colours.  This was a
new level of struggle for me.  If I wasn't on the design team, I
probably would have passed it up.  I just could not do anything that I
liked with these colours.  I tossed several ideas.  This was the best of
what I came up with and while it's OK, it's definitely not my most
favourite card.  Be sure to check out what the rest of the design team
created because there are some beauties on the [CC&S
Blog](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/10/challenge-490-colors.html)!!
