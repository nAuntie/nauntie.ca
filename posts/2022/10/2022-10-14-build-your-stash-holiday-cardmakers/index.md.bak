I'm back today with another card following the October sketch at [Build
Your Stash Holiday Cardmakers](https://byshcardmakers.blogspot.com/).  I
really love this sketch and could see going back to it a lot to use up
some of my patterned papers.  Have you played along yet?

I made this one a little more simple with only one embossed layer and
used a stamped image as the second panel.  I might have cheated a bit
with that.  I really loved the plaid along the edge of the card but
couldn't find anything else I wanted to use as another layer that went
with it.  So I skipped it!
