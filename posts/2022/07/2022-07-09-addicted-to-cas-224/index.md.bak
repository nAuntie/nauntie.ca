Happy Saturday!!  It's time for a new challenge with the team at
[Addicted to CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)!  For the next two
weeks we'd like you share how you interpret the code word of "kids"...
be sure to go to [the blog](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) to see
what the rest of the design team has done because there are some other
fabulous cards!

I went with a new baby card, partly because I needed a few in my stash! 
I had some fun with some light ink colours and a white on white embossed
panel.  The embossing takes away some of the clean and simple idea but I
think it is subtle enough that it works ok.
