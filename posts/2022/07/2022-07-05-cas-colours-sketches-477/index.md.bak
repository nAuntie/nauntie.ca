Patricia is our host for the month of July at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/07/challenge-477-colors.html)...
she chose this wonderfully right colour palette for our first challenge
this month.

Being a part of this design team, I have discovered that I am much
better at sketch challenges than I am with colour challenges.  When I
was only playing along, if the colours didn't speak to me, I didn't
play.  If the colours were at all challenging to me, I didn't play.  But
now I \*have\* to play each week and it's hard sometimes!

This was one of those weeks!
