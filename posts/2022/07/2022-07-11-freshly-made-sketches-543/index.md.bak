I loved the sketch the Cecile had for [Freshly Made
Sketches](https://freshlymadesketches.blogspot.com/2022/07/freshly-made-sketches-543-sketch-by.html)
this week... I'm glad I had a few minutes at my craft table to play
along!

My card originally much more plain as I stamped directly on the larger
white square and put the card together.  The more I looked at it the
more I knew it needed a little something more.  I cut a smaller square
and stamped on it then used my Perfect Layers tool to create a green
border and then put it on top of what I had originally created... and it
looks SO much better in my opinion!  It's still not anything but clean
and simple but the little pop of green made all the difference.
