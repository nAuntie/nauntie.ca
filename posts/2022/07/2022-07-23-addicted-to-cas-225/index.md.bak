The code word at [Addicted to CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)
is Nautical... I hope you'll play along.  The design team has created
some fun ideas that you can see
[HERE](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/).

I had a bit in my stash that would have been ok for this challenge but
nothing that was speaking to me... so I used some dies to create my
nautical themed card instead.
