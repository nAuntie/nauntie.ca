Happy Tuesday my friends... and a BIG happy birthday to my big sister! 
It's a milestone birthday for her today and I'm sad to not be
celebrating it with her.  

It's time for a new sketch challenge with [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/07/challenge-478-sketch.html). 
Patricia came up with this fun sketch for us all to try this week!  I
really look forward to seeing what \*you\* create!

I tried a few different things with this sketch and tossed them all in
the bin... until I decided to turn the sketch and then I came up with
something I liked on my first try.  My colours make this card eligible
for the current challenge at [Paper
Players](http://thepaperplayers.blogspot.com/2022/07/pp599-color-challenge-from-leanne.html)
too!
