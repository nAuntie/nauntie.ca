It's time for a new clean and simple challenge at [AAA
Cards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/)!  We want to see your cards with
the design only along the edge (you can choose which edge) with the
optional twist of "in the sea".

This was tough for me because I had two design team obligations that
were a similar theme back to back!  And the themes aren't something I
find easy to do in the first place!

For my card I ripped a piece of Post It Tape and ink blended my ocean
before splattering it with water to create some interest.  I added a
shark fin and a sentiment and called it done.
