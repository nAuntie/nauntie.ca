How on earth is it July already?!?!?!   I wish the warm months could
slow down just a little bit....  I love the extra sunlight and warmth
(especially compared to the cold and dark of winter).

I want you to click on this card so you can zoom in a little bit because
no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get my photo to look good at a
small size.  I LOVE how this card turned out and I just wish it looked
better in a photograph.  I got a new phone and sometimes the photos
aren't quite what I want them to be.
