I found a little relief from my shoulder issue thanks to a visit to my
physical therapist and a treatment of IMS.  She uses accupuncture
needles to poke in to the muscles to try to get them to release.  I'm
still hurting but not nearly as much as I have been over the last two
weeks.  I see her again early next week for another treatment... until
then I am trying to use my right arm "properly", stretching, using heat
and ice and trying to relax that arm as much as I can.  At least with
the broken arm there was good pain management.  With this, nothing was
taking the pain away.

While I did manage a little time in my creative space, I'm sharing a
card I made a few weeks ago.  I have been coveting a hot foil machine
and as soon as I think I'm ready to make the purchase, I talk myself out
of it.  For the card I'm sharing today, I used my Foil Quill with my
Silhouette to create a beautiful floral flower.  I will definitely need
to play more as the foil is truly stunning!
