It's time for a new challenge at
[CASology.](http://casology.blogspot.com/).. our cue for you for July is
WINDY.

I have a funny wind story... last fall we put up some security cameras
over our garage.  Since the trees have leafed this year, we often get
alerts from the cameras of "motion"... the other day we had hundreds of
alerts in the morning when we work up... each one of them was the leaves
on the trees thanks to the wind!

I went with the birthday candle idea for my windy card...  as I approach
52 later this month I'll have to have a lot of "windiness" to get all
those candles blown out!
