There's still time to play along with the July theme of Patterned Paper
at [Christmas Craft
Creations](https://christmas-craft-creations.blogspot.com/).  This is a
monthly challenge that helps you get at least one Christmas card made
every month.  The design team always has such wonderful creations... you
should check them out!

I got this one sheet of patterned paper at a garage sale and I honestly
don't know why I bought it.  I don't scrapbook and honestly the design
on it is really not suited to cutting down for Christmas cards.  But I
found a section that would work and I went for it....  the patterned
paper is the majority of my card.  I added a die cut banner, a stamped
sentiment and a few snowflakes to finish it off.
