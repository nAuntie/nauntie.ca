Another quick post from me as I am dealing with a seized muscle in my
back and sitting at my desk might kill me...  thankfully I have a few
cards made and ready to share since I can't sit here long enough to
craft (and creating while in pain isn't easy... creativity doesn't flow)

I have a die by Pink Fresh that does slimline strips and I like to use
that when making thin strips because I know they will be accurate.  I
Played around with two of the three sizes and some of that great
Stampin' Up! ombre glitter paper for this card.
