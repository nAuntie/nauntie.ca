Happy Sunday all... in true Calgary fashion, our first long weekend of
"summer" has delivered us a mixed bag of weather. Friday it was really
windy and wet and we had a little snow falling from the sky.  Saturday
was cool and mostly cloudy.  So far this morning the sun is shining and
it's warming up a little.  This is what you get with an elevation of
1045 m above sea level (that's 3428 ft). 

I have been living my days without the brace on my right arm, trying to
do as much for myself as possible as well as stretching.  I don't think
it's getting much better but I'll keep pushing.  I didn't sit down at my
computer or craft desk at all yesterday (and now, seeing how nice it is
today, I should have been creating yesterday!) but hope to spend some
time there today and tomorrow.

I created this card several weeks ago after finding a new to me
technique on the Clean and Simple Card Making FB group.  A member there
shared how she had used washi tape as her "stamp" so to speak... she
inked it up and laid it down to transfer the ink to the card.  I have
washi tape I never use so I figured "why not?".

And I love it!
