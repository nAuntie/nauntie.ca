I've got a quick clean and simple card to share with you today with the
new challenge at AAACards.  You have two weeks to play along with us
[HERE](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/) for your chance to be chosen as a
guest designer for an upcoming challenge.

I had another idea in my head for this card but I can't hold a pen well
enough to actually colour at the moment, so I had to scrap that idea and
come up with something else.  I think I've done one like this before but
it's a layout I really like so I think that's OK!
