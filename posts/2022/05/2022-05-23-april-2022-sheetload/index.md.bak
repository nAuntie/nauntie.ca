Before I broke my wrist, I played along with the April 2022 Sheetload of
Cards... The way it worked out trying to make one card, it made more
sense to make two since what I cut off was exactly what I needed for the
second piece.  These two cards are the same, but different

I really do love the size of a mini slimline!
