It's time for a new challenge at
[AAACards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/)! [AAA
Cards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/) is a clean and simple challenge
blog that posts a new challenge every two weeks.  We love to share our
ideas on the cue cards and, more importantly, love to see what others
come up with for our challenges!  I sure hope you'll play along and
share your creations with us [HERE](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/)!

Let me explain our graphic a bit... for challenge \#216, we want you to
use the colours that you see in the graphic... and \*optionally\* we'd
like to see a shaker card.  And on top of it all, we want that creation
to be clean and simple!  The two parameters you MUST follow to play are
the colours and clean and simple.

I chose to not make a shaker card... I just couldn't figure out what I
wanted to do since many things are still very difficult for me as the
wrist heals.  I chose a stack of elements in the colours of the graphic.
