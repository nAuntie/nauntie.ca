It's time for another challenge with [CAS Colours and
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/05/challenge-470-color.html)...
and this week it's a colour challenge.  For our colour challenges, you
must use all of the stated challenge colours. You may also use neutral
colours; however, the challenge colours should be the most noticeable
ones featured on your card. We use Stampin' Up colour names for
reference, but you are welcome to use any other companies' products as
long as you match the challenge colours as closely as possible.

I was rather stumped by these colours until I remembered these great
colour blocking dies by Spellbinders that I bought.  I cut out two of
each colour and layered them up to create this card.
