I have guidelines (for myself, not for others) as to what a sympathy
card should look like.  I don't judge what others create, but I do like
to keep the cards I create simple and "toned down".  I needed a card for
friends who recently suffered a loss and managed to create this card
using some extras that were in my dish.
