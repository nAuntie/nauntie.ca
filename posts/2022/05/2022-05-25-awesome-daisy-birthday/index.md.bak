I can't believe we're looking at the end of May already... next week
we'll be in to June!  It doesn't help that the weather hasn't been
consistently warm here in Calgary so I haven't switched the furnace from
heat to cool.  It's sad, really.

I really love the look of this pretty blue with the white flowers on
top... I added a little yellow to make it all pop!
