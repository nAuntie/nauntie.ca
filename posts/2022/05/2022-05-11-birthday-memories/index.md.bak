Hello crafty friends.  I have been crafting a little bit as I find it is
good therapy. both mentally and physically.  I am also working here and
there without my splint on (which I'm supposed to do) and while I'm not
typing as fast as I normally would, it's not the one handed hunt and
peck I've been doing in the last month.  With things working a little
more in my favour, I've decided to blog more often again ... I still
have cards to share that I created before my fall.

I played with some ink blending and created a few different panels of
the same colours, working on different cardstocks to see how they would
blend differently.  I wasn't sure about these colours together at first
but I really like how they turned out.
