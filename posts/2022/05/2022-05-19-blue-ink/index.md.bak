I had my first session at physical therapy yesterday and while things
are better than they had been, I still feel like there is a very long
way to go before this injury is a thing of the past.  I will be working
on stretches and trying to use my right hand/arm/wrist as normally as
possible.  There is still some swelling and the joint is extremely
stiff.  I'm feeling a little discouraged as I write this because I just
want this whole thing to be a memory.

It turns out that trying to create is good physical therapy so I will
continue to try to make cards... if only my mojo was still hanging out
around here LOL

This is another of the cards I created before my fall... it's very
similar to yesterday but with alcohol inks and Deco Foil instead (the
Deco Foil sticks to the parts of the alcohol ink that haven't completely
dried).
