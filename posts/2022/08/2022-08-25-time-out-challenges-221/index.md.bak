I know that Festive can refer to a lot of different things, but to me,
festive is Christmas... so I made a Christmas Card using a product I
bought at the end of the season last year and hadn't yet played with. 
This is one of the cards I made using the Create in Quads stencils from
Taylored Expressions.  I used some different colours than I normally
would and I love how it turned out!  For the last layer, I used some
glimmer paste to make it look like little bits of snow falling.  To
created my coloured mat, I just swiped ink along a piece of white
cardstock so that it would match the colour of ink I stencilled with.
