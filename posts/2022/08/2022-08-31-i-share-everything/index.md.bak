I like to share everything I make with you guys... even if I don't
really like how it turned out.  Some of the creations that I am not
impressed with have had the most "likes" on social media.  You never
know what others like, so I share everything in hopes of inspiring
someone else.

This is one of those cards.... I keep pushing it back to share because
I'm just not thrilled with it.  This was truly my first experiments with
my Glimmer machine....  I did the pink on the black and a cracked ice
foil on black for the mat layer.  The sentiment is one of the prefoiled
sentiments from Pink Fresh.

While it's not one of my favourites, it was so exciting to see the hot
foiling!!!
