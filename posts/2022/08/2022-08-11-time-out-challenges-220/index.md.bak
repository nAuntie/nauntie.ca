I had lots of ideas floating in my head but then I remembered that I had
some Stamplorations stencils in my stash and decided to use one of
them.  This slimeline trees stencil had never been used so I decided to
play with it.  I inked it up with Twilight ink first and then moved my
stencil ever so slightly and inked it up again with white pigment ink to
lighten the majority of each tree to create a bit of a shadow on the
right side of each limb.  I'm really pleased with how it turned out!
