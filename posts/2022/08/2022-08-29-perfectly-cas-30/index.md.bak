Happy Monday crafty friends!  I am playing along with the challenge at
[Perfectly
CAS](https://perfectlycas.blogspot.com/2022/08/challenge-30-emboss.html)
today that wants to see a CAS card with embossing.

I love the look of a hint of dry embossing on my creations and my first
thought was to add a little sweater texture to a Christmas card.  I
embossed an entire panel and used this strip for this card and the rest
on the card I posted yesterday.
