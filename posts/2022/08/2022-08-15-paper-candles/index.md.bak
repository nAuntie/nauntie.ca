I truly have a lot of patterned paper... and I honestly don't know why
since it often doesn't fit in to a clean and simple style!  I think
because it's just so darn pretty!  I go through periods where I use it a
lot and periods where I don't use it much.  I think I need to go through
a period where I don't buy it.

Thanks so much to Nadine
