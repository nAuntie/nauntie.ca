Happy Saturday crafty friends!  It's time for a new challenge with the
team at [Addicted to CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/)!  I hope
you'll head over to [the blog](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/) to
see what the design team has come up with for this challenge as there's
always some great inspiration by my team mates!  And we'd love to see
you play along with us too!

As I recently had another challenge that was a tropical theme (where I
did florals) I decided to turn my focus to a tropical drink instead. 
That little umbrella makes it tropical, right?  LOL
