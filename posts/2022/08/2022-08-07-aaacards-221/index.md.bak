It's time for the first clean and simple challenge of August with
[AAACards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/).  Our challenge for the next
two weeks is "small and few" which means you should use a few small
images on your card... the optional twist is (lady)bugs.  The design
team has some wonderful inspiration on [the
blog](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/).  We hope to see you playing along
with us!

I love ladybugs and they are so easy to colour for someone like me who
doesn't find colouring zen-inducing.  I thought I had a set of dies that
cut ladybugs but I couldn't find them so I went with these little guys
from a stamp set by MFT.  I drew a faint pencil line to get the shape I
wanted and then added the dots with a black marker. I waited about an
hour before I erased my pencil line because the last thing I wanted to
to was smudge that blank ink!
