I tried something a little different (at least for me) with this card...
nothing earth shattering, but I masked off the word celebrate before I
ink blended over a stencil.  Before I removed my mask, I also blended a
little more of the same colours of ink over the piece after removing the
stencil to soften the look of the colours a little and to really make my
word pop.  I like how it all looks kind of soft and dreamy.
