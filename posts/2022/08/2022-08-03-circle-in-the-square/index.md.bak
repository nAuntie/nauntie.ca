I don't make a lot of square cards.... there's nothing wrong with them,
they look great, but I just don't stray from my usual size very often. 
But for some reason, when I was designing this card, it wasn't working
on a regular A2 card so I changed things up and LOVE how it looks on the
square!  I added two extra pieces from the Pink Fresh Studio Rainbow
Floral Washi tape to the wreath for a little something "extra".
