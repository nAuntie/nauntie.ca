I am back to work this afternoon after my week of isolation thanks to
Covid.  I am feeling really good except a lingering tiredness but I'm
sure that will get better with time.  I really need to just take planned
holidays from work instead of illness and injury!!

A friend asked for some thank you cards recently so I did up a few
different designs for her.  I really liked the look of using the last
bit of ink on the blending brush to go over the white spots left behind
by stencilling so I did a few like this one...
