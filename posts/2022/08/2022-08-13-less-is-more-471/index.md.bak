There's a new clean and simple challenge over at the [Less is More
blog](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)....  we are looking to see
your one layer cards (which means the one layer is your card base) with
your favourite flower!  Be sure to head over to the [Less is More
blog](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/) to see the beautiful
creations by the rest of the design team and to share your creations
with us.

You knew this wouldn't be a difficult challenge for me.... I love
florals!  What you might not have expected is to see my first ever only
foiled card for this challenge!

This card front started out as me experimenting with my new Spellbinders
Glimmer Hot Foil System.  I foiled a 1/4 sheet of Hammermill cardstock
and then, after oohing and aahing, I didn't know what to do with it. 
And then it hit me... why do anything?  I foiled the sentiment in a
different colour and put the entire panel on the front of a folded
card.  While this layered on top, it is the exact same size as my card
so it's not considered a layer (a great trick if you were colouring with
Copics as well).  We are heading to a wedding this afternoon and this is
the card I'll be giving the bride and groom.
