Let me tell you how long it takes me type up a blog post using only my
left hand!  Most of my jobs over the years have been keyboard-centric so
I am a fast typer... in fact, I enjoy typing... but this one handed
thing is frustrating!!!

If only I had a dictation app on my laptop...

Anyway, it's time for a new clean and simple challenge with the team ay
[Addicted to CAS](http://addictedtocas.blogspot.com/).  Our code word
for challenge \#219 is "friendship".

My very good friend Bonnie celebrated her birthday last week so she was
the inspiration for my card for this challenge.  We are two peas in a
pod so this snarky card was absolutely perfect!
