It's time for another clean and simple challenge with the team at
[AAACards](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/).  Our challenge for the next
two weeks is "small and few" with the optional twist of Easter or
Spring.  I hope you'll play along with us by sharing your clean and
simple creations with us [HERE](https://aaacards.blogspot.com/)!

I did a quick and easy card thanks to this wonderful Lawn Fawn strip of
flowers.  I stamped them, coloured them quickly with a few spring
colours of Copics, stamped my greeting and then put the flowers on the
card with some foam adhesive.
