As I did have some cards created for the design teams I'm on before I
broke my wrist last week, I figured I'd still blog them.  Typing is slow
with only one hand!v  I am so sad to not be creating... I was on track
to have a record breaking number of cards made.  I haven't gone fore
more than 3 or 4 days without making cards in many weeks.

It's Tuesday which means another challenge with [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/04/challenge-466-color.html)... 
We have a colour challenge for you.

As you know, I don't have many Stampin' Up ink pads but i do have most
colours in cardstock... so I went with die cuts for my card.

I really like how these colours go together.

  

I hope you'll play along with us this week!!
