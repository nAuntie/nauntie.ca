I stamped up a sheet of those wonderful Pink Fresh Studio butterflies
and embossed them in white this time.  I used a finger dauber to add
colour to this butterfly after I'd cut it out, trying to keep colours in
specific areas... it helped that I used similar colours.  My rectangle
element I created by masking off a rectangle on the front of my card and
blending Twisted Citron directly on to the card front.
