<span style="background-color: #fefdfa;">Bhavya is the host at [CAS
Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/04/challenge-464-color.html)
for the month of April. She has chosen a great 'garden' themed set of
colours for us to use as her first colour challenge this month.  I can't
wait to see how others interpret these colours!</span>

For our colour challenges, you must use all of the stated challenge
colours. You may also use neutral colours; however, the challenge
colours should be the most noticeable ones featured on your card. We use
Stampin' Up colour names for reference, but you are welcome to use any
other companies' products as long as you match the challenge colours as
closely as possible. 

I don't have much for Stampin' Up! inks (I have most of their cardstocks
though) so I had to get creative with my colour choices for this
challenge.  I used a Gina K layering stencil with some Post It Tape to
create my design down the edge of my card panel.
