This will be my last post with [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/04/challenge-467-sketch.html)
until my wrist heals enough to craft again.  My surgery on Friday went
well and I'm in less pain than I was before surgery.  I have no idea
when I'll be able to do things with the right hand again... I'm guessing
I'll have some answers after my surgical follow up on the 2nd.

But for today, my card using the current sketch at [CAS Colours &
Sketches](https://cascoloursandsketches.blogspot.com/2022/04/challenge-467-sketch.html)...
I wanted to leave my background white but I just couldn't.

I used a stencil from Studio Katia and the Nuvo Glimmer Paste in
moonstone to add a little something extra to the card... in doing so
it's not quite as clean and simple as it should be.
