I'm really missing my creative space now... I had surgery on my right
wrist yesterday and am hoping things will start to feel better again
soon.  I'm only sharing design team creations now as typing blog posts
is very slow with only one hand.

It's Saturday so it's time for another challenge with the team ay
[Simply Less is More](http://simplylessismoore.blogspot.com/)...

I focussed my one layer card on the bottom of my card. tending towards
the right.  I masked off an area, stamped and embossed the sentiment and
stamped the floral.  I then reverse masked and used Distress Inks and
finger daubers to create the rainbow.

I hope you'll play along!
