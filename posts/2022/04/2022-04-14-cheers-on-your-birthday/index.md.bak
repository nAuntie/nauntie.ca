Some more fun with those Pink Fresh Studio small butterflies and Tim
Holtz inks.  While I love how easy it was to get a lot of butterflies
stamped and cut out at once, I wonder if I should have bought a stamp
set with individual stamps and dies instead so that I didn't feel the
need to overload on them all at once like I did with the flowers and now
the butterflies.  I hope I haven't burnt myself out of wanting to use
these two sets.
